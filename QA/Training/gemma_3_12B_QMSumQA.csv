"There were two main parts in the detailed design. Firstly, the prototype presentation, Industrial Designer presented the design on the wheel, the button, and the base of the remote control. Secondly, Marketing presented eleven points to be evaluated based on the findings in marketing trend reports and company strategy marketing. Besides, the group had a point calculation on each evaluation criterion.","The team members first reviewed the basic components of the remote control and decided that it would be with a wheel for changing channels or volumes, a button serving as the power button, and a base with a squishy, spongy, rubbery feel, which was interchangeable. Next, the team members discussed the shape, colour and"
"Project Manager suggested that the group might need to discuss changing an aspect of the remote. According to the previous evaluation, the worst one was material. Thus, the group gave suggestions on the smallish size, smashed or resembled fruit shape, and printed patterns on rubber design. The group also suggested changing batteries, but they ended up agreeing that there were no problems in battery design.","The team was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the remote control, such as its shape, color, and material. They decided to change its shape. The user interface suggested making it look like a vegetable, but this idea was abandoned because the vegetable shape did not fit the comfort of the user. In the end, they agreed"
"Firstly, Project Manager asked about the room for creativity in fruit and squishiness. User Interface thought the prototype making was creatively stimulating and the product has met all the criteria. Next, Project Manager reflected on his leadership and management role in the group. Other members gave recognition to his performance and everyone's cooperation. Then, Project Manager asked about the convenience of the means for the materials and the pen used in the presentation. Group evaluated based on the user-friendly and the working efficiency.",Project Manager thought the team worked together well and the process was creative. Industrial Designer agreed. User Interface thought the process was fun and the team came up with a satisfactory product. But User Interface and Industrial Designer thought some of the materials and tools they used were not that helpful. Especially PowerPoint. Project Manager thought leadership was slightly
"Instead of changing the shape of the remote, the group first discussed changing the batteries because some group mates gave a point under three. However, Marketing thought batteries were easy to insert so it would not be a problem anymore. In addition, all the group members gave the shape of the remote only two points. And they needed to change the most critical one. The shape and the squishiness of the remote were an innovation in terms of technology. Therefore, they all agreed to change the shape.","The group found out that the current shape of the remote, like other controllers, was not that comfortable to hold. So the group might need to redesign the shape. Also, the group wanted to find a way to incorporate the fruit theme into the remote. Last but not least, different shapes could be produced at a relatively"
"Project Manager thought his leadership was crap personally and he never did a management position. While Industrial Designer thought Project Manager did tell them when to start and when to end, which was important in good leadership. And User Interface thought Project Manager did a good job in leadership because they didn't have set roles so much, which was a democratic process. Marketing supplemented that everyone got blended quite well.","Industrial Designer thought Project Manager did a good job in leading the team, as he controlled the time and let the team have enough time to discuss and make decisions. User Interface agreed. Even though Project Manager himself doubted his abilities as a leader, he did appreciate the teamwork spirit in the group. Marketing also complemented the good teamwork"
"Both User Interface and Industrial Designer thought it was not helpful to use PowerPoint to present. Instead, they preferred writing notes for massive information, while Marketing and Project Manager thought PowerPoint materials were quite useful. Specifically, Project Manager mentioned that he felt ignorant when the group was explaining things.","Industrial Designer thought that Microsoft PowerPoint was not useful and suggested using the Unix system instead. User Interface agreed and suggested that the team could make their own materials. Project Manager thought that the materials provided by the company were not helpful to the team. Marketing insisted that his materials were helpful to the project. Overall, the team agreed"
"PhD F wanted the group to record different meetings with the same group to help in tasks such as summarization, the Professor D however, wanted random meeting participants to have diversity that would be instrumental in acoustical research.","Future meetings could be recorded in a way that allowed for the same group of people to be present, but in different situations. This would provide a range of summaries, as the content of the meetings would vary. In contrast, acoustic research might benefit more from a fair amount of really random meetings, with a variety of speakers"
Postdoc E was championing the need to get proficient English speakers so as to allow for a stable language model. This did not mean limiting the type of accents that the speakers had but rather ensuring the speakers could proficiently follow the English grammar when they expressed themselves.,"The group discussed the need for more native speakers in their data collection efforts. Postdoc E suggested advertising the project to linguistics graduate students, who are likely to have the necessary language skills. Others agreed that the goal was to get people to participate in meetings with a certain level of fluency. They did not want to exclude anyone"
One proposed solution was to set up another room in the linguistics department. This needed a dedicated partner and safety of the equipment for it to work. Professor D talked about making the equipment portable allowing it to be transported from meeting to meeting.,"The group first considered setting up a recording booth in the linguistics department, but this idea was abandoned due to concerns about noise pollution. Next, they thought of using a portable recording equipment, but this plan was deemed unfeasible because of the high cost involved. The last resort was to bring all the participants down to the main"
"The group wanted to introduce portable equipment so as to get more meetings from different groups. However, this was challenged by the complexity of setting up the recording equipment.","The professor expressed a desire to make the equipment portable so it could be taken to different locations. The group thought that space might be an issue, but they suggested the phonology lab as a possible location. They also discussed the types of meetings that could be recorded and the kinds of data that would be useful to collect."
"Grad B said that archiving of the data by creating a clone had been done, though it took eleven hours. However, Grad B commented that accessing the data would be much faster. This archiving had freed ten gigabytes of free space. Additionally, two copies would be made: one offisite, another onsite.","Grad B was in the process of converting the Broadcast News data into a format suitable for the team’s disk space. This process was taking a lot of time and Grad B was concerned that the team would run out of disk before all the data was converted. So far, eleven hours had been spent on copying data and"
"Professor D said they would be getting another disk rack that would bring in four thirty-six gigabyte disks, increasing the space. Additionally, the directories of Aurora data, Carmen’s Data and SPINE were likely to be moved.","The team was also looking into other vendors for hard drives. Additionally, the team would get more space by moving data off of the backed-up disks onto non-backed-up disks. The team was also trying to better organize the data so that they could delete old data and free up space."
"Based on the presentations of the user interface designer, the industrial designer and the marketing expert which were about the product requirements, the project manager concluded that the new remote control should be powerful, easy to use, fashionable, recognizable and only for television. Furthermore, the remote control should use the Internet rather than teletext due to the spread of the Internet.","The remote control would only be used for television. Therefore, the remote control would not have functions to control the recorder or other devices. Also, the remote control should have the colour of the product, and the slogan on it. Besides, it should be powerful and easy to use. The remote control should not be designed"
"The user interface designer recommended to design a Google TV controller because Google was very successful for its powerful functions and friendly user interface. Also, to make the customers able to use the product without learning the manual, the industrial designer suggested applying some international standards such as some pictograms.","The user interface designer pointed out that the remote control with many functions should be easy to use. The industrial designer then recommended to refer to international standards in designing the remote control, so that different kinds of remote controls could be used in the same way. For example, the escape and the power off button could be designed in"
"The industrial designer expressed concern about how to connect TV to the Internet and the user interface designer said a set box would enable TV to surf the Internet. However, the technology was not very popular, which might be an obstacle for global usage of the product.",Industrial Designer thought that the remote control could be connected to the internet so that the TV could surf the web. User Interface told the group that there was already a box in the TV for this function. The group agreed that the internet function was not popular and should not be included in the remote control. Project Manager then asked
"The group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller because it was cheaper than a laser. Secondly, the industrial designer preferred a wireless remote control as it was easier to manage but the suggestion was doubted by the marketing and the project manager considering the cost and user requirements. Another thing was about the buttons. The marketing advised having less buttons because only ten percent of the buttons were actually in use and people tended to zap a lot.","The industrial designer proposed to design an infrared control based on the product requirements. This kind of remote control is simple in technology and cheap in price. The remote control can be made wireless, which is more practical. In terms of functionality, it is proposed to combine multiple functions into one button to reduce the number of buttons."
"Firstly, the industrial designer said the wireless technology would cost 8 Euros which was higher than the manager's expectation. Secondly, whether the users would like to have a wireless control or not was unknown and the marketing would go to figure it out. Finally, having a link between the remote control and the television would prevent control from losing.","The industrial designer thought that a wireless control could be more practical and cheaper, while the project manager thought that a cable link would be more feasible and user-friendly. The project manager was concerned that a wireless link would create other problems, such as getting lost. Also, he thought that it would be more cost-effective"
"The industrial designer recommended mixing several functions in one button by having a switch menu. For example, the category the functions into several classes and link switch menu to this kind of this category of functions.","The user interface designer recommended to mix several functions into one button to reduce the buttons. For example, when users didn't use the recording function, they could switch to the TV control function. In this way, the remote control could have less buttons and still have powerful functionality. Project manager, however, was concerned that"
"Based on earlier experiments and questionnaires, the marketing found that seventy-five percent of the users thought most remote controls ugly. Thus, the group decided to make the product look fancy so that people would pay more. However, how to make remote control look fancy was a big problem because different people have different opinions about fancy. What's more, the project manager thought the product should be recognizable and attractive.","Ugly remote control was a pain. To solve this problem, the marketing expert suggested collecting data on user preference on remote control appearance. The industrial designer pointed out that fancy was subjective. The project manager thought that the remote control should be attractive to customers and be the image of the society. The marketing expert suggested that the"
"They thought in order to make the product look fancy, the product should have many colours instead of having one grey standard to meet different customers' needs.","The user interface designer and the industrial designer both agreed that the remote control could be made into different colours to meet with the different preferences of the customers. However, the project manager was concerned about the cost of production. The user interface designer suggested that the customers could be asked about their preferred colours, and the remote controls could"
"The project manager agreed that the product should be good-looking but having many colours wasn't a good idea because it would increase the product cost. Also, the project manager thought the remote control should be marked with the image of the society so that one can recognize it at a glance.","The project manager thought that a fancy appearance might increase the production cost of the remote control. He wanted the remote control to be attractive and to have a fashionable image that could react to the users. He thought that the appearance of the remote control should not be completely yellow, and it was better to have several options so that"
User Interface introduced a remote control easy to use and a multi-functional one and preferred the former as it was more user-friendly. Industrial Designer agreed and proposed that a stick or round button for volume control and channel selection could be used and also suggested that the ten digits could be substituted by voice recognition.,"The user interface designer suggested two kinds of remote controls, one with many functions but less user-friendly, the other with few functions but more user-friendly. The team decided to go for the simpler one. They scrapped some features, like teletext. They kept the most basic features, like volume and program selection."
Industrial Designer thought the ten buttons looked a bit dull so speech recognition could be added to solve this problem. But he was concerned that power saving could be difficult when implementing speech recognition.,"Industrial Designer thought that the ten digits might be irrelevant because there were only thirteen different Dutch channels, and elder people would only use five of them. Also, he believed that there should be something specific with the shape, size, or color of the digits to make the remote control look fancier. In addition, he suggested"
"User Interface found two kinds of remote controls: the multi-functional one and the one easy to use. He emphasized on user-friendliness, but considering that the target people were less than forty years old, multi-function should also be taken into account.","User Interface preferred ease of use remote control over multi-function one, for it was more user-friendly and trendy. But User Interface also agreed that multi-function remote control was not without its advantages. In addition, User Interface pointed out that teletext buttons were unnecessary in the market. Users desired a remote control with"
"Industrial Designer introduced how the remote control worked and supposed that they should use infrared so that the remote control could communicate with most TV sets. He also proposed to use energy-friendly components and save the cost of circuit boards to develop elaborate lighting techniques. In order to prevent people from losing the remote control, the team decided to implement an audio signal. In terms of energy source, the team preferred to have a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged.","Industrial Designer suggested using infrared because most TVs had infrared controls. The group discussed a finding function to help users locate the remote. Industrial Designer suggested using a base station next to the TV, but it might be too costly. The group further discussed a cradle for recharging and thought it would be cheap. There would be additional components"
"User Interface proposed that a base station next to the TV could be a solution, but Industrial Designer pointed out that this could be technically complicated and would cost a lot. So the team eventually adopted Marketing's advice to implement an audio signal.","Marketing suggested that the remote control could produce audio signals to help customers find it. Project Manager agreed and suggested that the remote control could be connected to the television set. Once lost, the remote control would beep to remind customers of its position. However, this idea may increase the cost of the product. User Interface proposed that"
"Industrial Designer proposed to incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries, but Project Manager agreed more with Marketing's proposal to include a cradle.","Industrial Designer suggested some hybrid devices incorporated a solar panel and rechargeable batteries. In this way, the battery could be recharged in a light room. This might be achieved for the cost of twelve dollars and fifty cents. Moreover, the cradle for recharging would be very cheap, as it was mass-produced and adapted. Project Manager"
"The group discussed recording equipment issues, including the purchase of two additional headsets and the prospect of getting a new base station and a set of wireless microphones to replace those wired microphones currently in use.",The team was waiting for two new microphones to be assembled. The old microphones were giving out and were being replaced. The team was also thinking of getting more headsets and another wireless microphone setup. The wireless setup would cost $900 for the base station and $800 per channel. The team decided to go
"Efforts will be made to ensure that recording conventions are consistent across ICSI, the University of Washington, and SRI.","The team was using a combination of head-mounted microphones and lapel microphones. The head-mounted microphones were prone to problems, so the team decided to switch to using only lapel microphones for future meetings."
"Approximately 32-35 hours of meeting data have been recorded, roughly 30 hours of which comprise non-digits recordings. The transcribers have begun performing digit extraction (see abstract for Bmr013) and should be finished within a few days. Approximately 11 hours of speech have been transcribed.",There are 35 hours of meetings recorded so far. The transcribers have finished 11 hours of work. Postdoc F is currently working on data cleaning and channelization. A filter is being developed to tag and categorize comments.
"Efforts by speaker fe008 are in progress to ensure that transcripts are clean (i.e. spell checked), channelized, and conform to set conventions regarding the coding of numbers, acronyms, and explicit comments (e.g. door slams, coughs, and laughter). Subsequent efforts by speaker fe008 will be to tighten up boundaries on the time bins. Inter-annotator agreement was reported to be very good. Speaker mn014's multi-channel speech/non-speech segmenter is in use.","The transcript was in the process of being cleaned and channelized. Work had begun on transcribing digits. Transcribers were putting together information on numbers, acronyms, and other features. A filter was being developed to tag and categorize comments."
"Marketing summarized the user requirements according to the market reports. Users expected a fancy look, technological innovation, and minimization of repetitive strain injury. The team did a preliminary rating using a seven-point scale. The results were that the remote control's fashion style and location function were most highly rated, but the team was not satisfied enough with the minimization of repetitive strain injury. The team agreed on further modifications to the current prototype.","The market department required the product to have a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, be easy to use, incorporate current fashion trends, have a spongy texture and strong design colours, and be able to locate easily. The industrial department designed a prototype with a curvy shape, rubber case and buttons. The market department rated the"
"Marketing initially doubted that Industrial Designer was limited in the use of materials for the prototype, which would harm the fashion style. Marketing was soon convinced by Industrial Designer, however, that the changeable faces would allow users to customize their remote controls. Besides, the rubber case would give a spongy feel. Marketing thus rated one point for Industrial Designer's style design.","Marketing agreed that the prototype had successfully incorporated current fashion trends in terms of its spongy texture and fruit and vegetable design colours. Therefore, Marketing gave a one in the evaluation. Since the prototype was only limited in the use of materials, the team would need to further customize it. Still, the overall design was satisfactory to Marketing"
"Marketing considered the design of pointers unfeasible, for many users were prone to zap. Project Manager recommended the slight and small-sized buttons with more space in between. Regretfully, the team failed to come up with a perfectly feasible solution to the problem. The team thus gave low rate points to the prototype's minimization of repetitive strain injury.","The team agreed that the button type and material they had chosen for the bottom half of the remote control could reduce RSI. Also, a slight size increase could ease the problem of users moving around to hit accurately the buttons in between. With all these considerations, the team gave an average rating of four out of seven for this"
"The team calculated the cost of the remote control in the Euro. The team included one regular chip, one kinetic cell, one double-curved bottom, one push button, one LCD screen, as well as rubber and plastic materials. The team decided to recommend voice recognition to business customers. Once the budget increased, voice recognition would be incorporated. Overall, the present cost was 12.5 Euros and was under the budget.","First, the team members needed to agree on the kinetic energy source. After some discussion, they decided to go ahead with it. Then, they had to make sure the electronics, battery and case material they had chosen were within the budget. They found that some of their choices, like the double-curved case,"
"User Interface recommended the standard batteries to replace the kinetic batteries and lower the cost. Marketing was promised by User Interface that the change in battery type would not make any big difference in shape and colours. However, Marketing was still uncertain about the replacement. User Interface further explained that users were used to paying little attention to batteries which were installed internally.","User Interface thought that customers had never commented on the battery, so they should not compromise on the shape and colour instead. Also, User Interface suggested that they could try a standard battery. Compared with the kinetic one, it was not as expensive and it would not be a huge difference with the cost. The group agreed to"
"Industrial Designer implicated that if the kinetic batteries were replaced by the standard batteries, the voice recognition would have to be taken away as well. Project Manager, therefore, made a compromise that the team might provide the voice recognition in an upgraded version for the business class who expected high office specifications.","Industrial Designer thought that voice recognition was unnecessary and expensive. Marketing insisted that voice recognition was essential and agreed to be incorporated into the remote control. Project Manager accepted Marketing's proposal and decided to design the voice recognition system based on the budget. Moreover, Project Manager suggested that voice recognition could be initially offered to business class customers"
"The group thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria. Although they had brilliant ideas and designed a best remote control within their capacity, they just designed a product of high quality but low acceptance.","Marketing laid stress on the fancy look and feel of the remote control, which was agreed by other team members. Then the team evaluated the product with respect to innovation and ease of use. Also, the team agreed that the remote control was sufficiently featured with high quality. However, the overall acceptance of the remote control was low"
User Interface believed that voice recognition was hard to learn while Industrial Designer argued that the remote control had two parts and everyone could use the basic part. He also pointed out that an advanced user would like to explore additional functions.,"User Interface thought voice recognition was hard to learn for the elderly and thus the remote control was not that easy to use. Industrial Designer argued that the remote control was basic and easy to use for novices. For the elderly, it was also easy to use as long as they didn't use the voice recognition function. Marketing"
Marketing thought that the basic layout was mundane but the voice recognition was brilliant. User Interface added that it did not have the digits but had all the features a normal remote control had. Industrial Designer agreed but pointed out that they just design the best product within their capacity. Project agreed and concluded that it was of high quality but low acceptance.,"User Interface thought the remote control lacked the basic digit button and hence lacked competitiveness. However, Project Manager thought the remote control was very advanced and incorporated many features. Industrial Designer agreed and pointed out that the remote control was very simple and easy to use. In addition, Industrial Designer thought the remote control was a high-quality"
"Project Manager revealed that it would cost 22 Euros at current standards so they should leave out some characteristics that could not add much value. Since it could be dull and simple without those characteristics, the group supposed that the selling price could be raised to 50 Euros.","Solar cells were deemed to be a luxury that was not necessary for the basic functionality of the remote. Voice recognition was also considered to be a costly addition that was not essential. Instead, the team decided to focus on creating a durable and attractive casing for the remote, as well as ensuring that it had a simple and user"
Project Manager revealed that it would be over budget so they had to make some changes. He proposed to reduce costs by leaving out solar cells and not using voice recognition. Then User Interface supposed that the buttons could be made of plastics and Industrial Designer proposed to make the remote control straight and simple.,"The initial design of the remote control was priced at 22 Euros, exceeding the budget of 12.5 Euros. The high cost was mainly due to the use of solar cells and the incorporation of various features. To reduce the cost, the group first considered removing the solar cells. However, this was not"
"Since the prototype was over budget, Industrial Designer proposed to raise the selling price to 50 Euros. He thought it was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality.","Industrial Designer proposed that the price of this remote control with high technology should be about 50 Euros. Compared with other remote controls of the same kind, this price is very reasonable and attractive to customers. Moreover, this price is very high-end, which can help the company to build a good brand image. Last"
"User Interface and Industrial designer drawn dolphin and pig, which the two animals have smart and easy-to-draw features. Marketing suggested a horse and Project Manager thought they should design a remote control that's water resistant, strong and furry. Also he mentioned that remote control will be priced at 25 Euros and aimed to earn a revenue of fifty million Euros. Therefore, Project Manager encouraged teammates to reflect on experience when designing its function and format.",The group was asked to draw their favourite animals and describe its characteristics. User Interface drew a dolphin and Marketing drew a horse. Project Manager drew a pig. They all agreed that it should be soft and furry. Project Manager proposed water-resistant design and strong material. The group proposed tactile remote control. Marketing set the selling
"The initial feature suggested by Marketing was easy to find and User Interface suggested a call button on the television. And Marketing wanted something that could vibrate or had a signal if it had no sound. However, they were not sure whether it is expensive to design it. So Project Manager suggested designing a magnet or portable phone based couch for the remote control, which people no need to walk over the TV to find it.","Project Manager agreed with User Interface's suggestion of the call button. Project Manager pointed out that this kind of design already existed in portable phones, so there was no need to make a new invention. User Interface and Industrial Designer both agreed with Project Manager's analogy. Project Manager then proposed the design of couches with remote"
"Project Manager asked if the remote control needed to be made larger to avoid losing it. At the first beginning, User Interface suggested bigger, while Project Manager suggested a hand-sized device. Considering the light feature and putting noise on it, User Interface thought it would be feasible to make it mobile with a target price at 25 Euros.",The remote control should be hand-held size and it was agreed that it could not be too big. The team also discussed the possibility of adding something like a light on the remote control so that it would be easier to find. User Interface even suggested that the remote control could be made mobile so that it could run around
"Since User Interface initially suggested less button feature on the remote control, so Project Manager suggested a telly screen like what phones have. And User Interface mentioned about the master control in electronic houses. However, User Interface thought it is a bit expensive to create this feature, but Marketing mentioned the similar screen in phones is in the acceptable cost range. So, Project Manager agreed and suggested further discussion in the coming meeting.","Marketing first brought up the idea of using the TV screen as the screen on the remote control to reduce the cost. Project Manager agreed on it. Then Marketing mentioned that mobile phones with screens were very cheap, so the cost of adding a screen to the remote control would also be very cheap. User Interface agreed. Project Manager"
"User Interface reiterated that the remote control should have a robust and water resistant function. Marketing also mentioned a good tactile feel for the remote control function, which doesn't make hand sweat a lot. Therefore, Project Manager suggested a clip feature on the remote control so that people can clip it to their device.","Marketing suggested that the remote control should have a good feel and be water-resistant. Project Manager agreed and suggested that a clip could be attached to the remote control for users to clip it to somewhere, like a pocket. Project Manager thought this would be another good feature of the remote control. User Interface agreed. Marketing did"
"The selling price goal is 25 Euros and profit aim is fifty million Euros. Selling target is four million and the profit goal is fifty percent. So Project Manager mentioned that the group hopes to sell the remote control device internationally, instead of in Scotland or some European country.",Project Manager proposed the plan for the selling price of 25 Euros and the profit aim of 50 million Euros. The group then went on to discuss the marketing target of the product. User Interface asked how many they should sell to meet the profit goal. Marketing answered that they should sell 4 million.

"A pressing concern for the group is the DARPA meeting in July, which is only a short time away, and for which they would like to have some progress. ",The professor thought that the team should come up with something for the DARPA meeting in mid-July. The team was supposed to work on the transcriber interface. There was talk about doing something with the whiteboard and generating summaries. The professor thought that the team should generate a report for the meeting.
"For the DARPA meeting in July, the group proposed that they should have the question answering mock-up and transcriber interface ready for then, and also have data available.",The professor asked Adam to continue with the transcription demo and interface work. The group had some way of answering questions posed to the system and retrieving relevant information from it. The professor noted that the meeting was starting late and there was not much time left before the July DARPA meeting.
The final english SmartKom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised.,The transcriber pool has been growing and the project is on schedule with regards to transcriptions. Transcribers are currently editing meeting data collected previously. A sample of the transcriptions will be made available to DARPA in July.
"Segmentation for the recogniser has been done by hand which the group consider ""cheating"", instead now they want to use Thilo's automatic segmenter.","In order to move towards having more accurate results, the recognizer has been updated to perform recognition on automatically generated segments rather than hand-segmented data."
"The classifier segmentation work is going well, but needs more data to improve results since non-native speaker data cannot be used.",The group is planning to move to doing recognition on automatically generated segments.
"To improve the performance of Thilo's automatic segmenter, this is going to be retrained and adapted to run with Thilo's posteriors and speaker background models.","The presegmentation has been modified to include more accurate boundaries. Additionally, the models for background noise have been adapted to the meeting data."
"First, Grad E proposed a question about better discriminating the definition of user and situation models, and it was necessary to set values for the models. Then, they discussed the issues in terms of the user's running budget, which was vital for the outcome of decisions. They tried to design a set of terms to describe the user's financial policy, such as thrift, average, spendy, or more finer scale ones.","The team was working through defining the nodes in the belief-net that would link together various factors influencing meeting data. For the user, they decided to include cheap, average, or spendy as possible values. Similarly, for the situation, they wanted to include factors that would explain the reasonability of a meeting. The"
"The reason why they mentioned user budget was that they wanted to take this example to further discuss the value for user model. Also, user budget was an important factor for the outcomes of decisions. Then, they tried to decide which set of words could represent the budget better. Finally, they found that the words that could describe financial policy of users, such as user thrift, was appropriate.","The group agreed that the user's budget may influence the outcome of decisions. The running budget could be a good way to keep a running total of things. In addition, the group thought that people could be classified into different types based on their financial policy, such as cheap, average, or spendy. It would"
"Grad E proposed the idea that Go-there decision was also worth thinking about. Professor B suggested that the decision could stick to the discourse properties as a placeholder. With regard to the lack of ontologies, Professor B thought that it could use the same properties like exhibiting and selling. Grad E doubted the choice of binary EVA values, but Professor B insisted that it was still necessary to make this choice. Then the group members discussed the layout of belief-nets, for example, the connection between Go-there nodes and other ones such as endpoints. And Professor B reminded me that the belief-nets should not have loops.","The team decided that the endpoint decision node could feed into the Go-there node. They also had to make sure there would be no loops in the belief network. Additionally, they needed to define the values for the EVA nodes. The ontology did not provide sufficient information for the construction of the belief network. The team thought"
"Grad E first started the topic about Go-there decision, and then proposed the question about how to represent discourse. Though Professor B insisted on using true-and-false values, Grad E challenged Professor B's opinion by taking examples about whether people really wanted to go some place or not when they asked how to get there.","The endpoint could feed into the Go-there simply without any um intermediate nodes. Also, to avoid loops, the belief network should be broken up. The problem of loops would get even worse if it involved the computation of probabilities. Even though the exact probability computation was not discussed, the issue of loop was raised. Similarly"
"Professor B first emphasized the necessity of combining influences mathematically and asked Grad D to further explain the potential solutions. Then the students discussed the computation methods including weighted combination and mixture of experts, based on the mechanism of belief-nets. But there was no consensus on which method should be applied in belief-nets.","The team wanted to find a principled way of computing the probabilities that various factors contribute to the decision node. They first attempted to assign equal weights to each expert but decided that some experts were more reliable than others. Thus, they came up with two solutions. The first one was to assign a single weight to each expert."
Grad D first said that different experts were reliable in different situations and it was necessary to organically combine them to make the network adapt to diverse situations. The network could be divided into several parts and the network would decide which of the experts would be trusted in this particular situation. Grad D then answered other group members' questions about the layout of mixture of expert models and their detailed computation process.,"Grad D proposed the mixture of experts to deal with the unreliability of a single expert. In this model, the experts would be augmented with a new node called ""H"", which would take the inputs from other nodes and decide which expert was more reliable in a particular situation. The number corresponding to the most reliable expert would"
"The thesis proposal presents the idea of ""construal"" and makes claims as to how inferences are drawn in a probabilistic relational model by using information from the ontology, situation, user and discourse models. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy.","The thesis is about a probabilistic relational model that has some general, domain-general rules about how things are construed. The goal is to use the models to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what."
"The talk will present the work that is currently being done at ICSI including examples of inference of user intentions and of the recordings of the on-going data collection. The talk will also outline the theoretical (X-schemas, image schemas, Bayes-nets) and neural background.","The group was introduced to the idea of embodied and situated cognition, drawing on examples from primate behavior and suggesting that understanding language may require understanding its connection to the body and the world. A review of the digital Apollo corpus was presented, highlighting its utility for various linguistic and cognitive studies. The challenges of interpreting and representing real-"
"As the talk at EML will also refer to a theoretical framework, it was suggested that along with presenting NTL and the piece on mirror neurons, it also alludes to relevant fMRI work. The neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups. The language analysis itself will be introduced in terms of image schemas. On the other hand, it was arranged for more feedback on the thesis proposal to be sent by email. The latest version of the construction formalism will also be needed to complete the presentation.",The group was interested in learning more about the neurons and the FMRI research. The professor wanted to know how the group could explain language learning with their models. There was a plan to conduct research that would allow the team to observe the brain. The team thought that the big picture was understanding how language worked. One interesting

"Industrial Designer supposed that natural feeling could be a factor. Marketing agreed and revealed that the younger target group preferred soft material but not necessarily a real sponge. Then User Interface proposed to use rubber, which was agreed by the whole team.","The team agreed that the feel of the material had to be spongy. Marketing suggested that they could use soft material and make it colourful or like cell phones, exchangeable covers. Project Manager further suggested that they could make a few very colourful ones, and a very traditional cover. User Interface mentioned the example of Bananar"
"Industrial Designer introduced uncurved, single-curved and double-curved design at first. User Interface and Project Manager thought that uncurved design was too dull and Industrial Designer pointed out that double-curved design would make it impossible to use scroll-wheels, so the team selected single-curved design eventually.","The team was making a trade-off between the stylish look and the functional demands of the remote control. On the one hand, the team agreed that a curved design was preferable to a dull flat one. On the other hand, they had to use scroll wheels in the remote control, which was incompatible with the double-"

Voice recognition was another way of controlling the remote. The group would further investigate the cost of adding these features. Also, the group would see if there was a need for an extra high-"
Industrial Designer proposed to use scroll-wheels integrated with buttons. User Interface doubted its practicability and supposed that a round button with four directions could be better. But Project Manager liked the idea of scroll-wheels as it might attract young customers and suggested that they could be used to mute the device.,Industrial Designer thought that solar power was a traditional but feasible option. He and User Interface discussed the merits of scroll-wheels. The industrial designer pointed out that such wheels were not new and had been used in many other devices. Yet he and the project manager thought that scroll-wheels could still be a good way to make
"Industrial Manager revealed that if LCD was used, they had to choose advanced chips. Project Manager thought it was within the budget and LCD displays could add extra high-tech feeling. User Interface then pointed out that they already had too many high-tech substances including scroll-wheels, voice recognition and a fancy look so they didn't need to use LCD displays.","Industrial Designer suggested that LCD was a bit costly and not very standard. Also, the team thought that with the scroll wheels, the speaker and the rubber material, their remote had already incorporated enough advanced technology. Thus, they came to the conclusion that the LCD display was unnecessary. Project Manager later agreed on this point. Meanwhile"
"On battery issue, Industrial Designer expressed a desire to minimize the size of the battery. Meanwhile, cost, power consumption, wireless range and data transmission were supposed to be considered. User Interface's presentation followed. The remote control design would be simplified and user-friendly. To make the style more trendy, User Interface decided on a flip-top model.","Firstly, the team agreed that the triple A battery was the smallest and cheapest one, however, it might be bulky and the team might consider other options. Secondly, the team might design a flip-top model which could access a wide range of audiences and incorporate shockproof features and a soft button. Also, the team"
"Industrial Designer admitted that current remote controls were mostly powered by triple A batteries. However, Industrial Designer also pointed out that they were bulky, although they had been the smallest fit-in batteries at present. Industrial Designer expressed a desire to find a smaller alternative for triple A batteries.",Industrial Designer thought that the size of the battery was considerable since most remote controls were chunky because of the size of the batteries. He also wondered about the power consumption and how much was needed to send the data across. He concluded that the small size could be achieved by using a smaller battery. He left the design of the
"The market research presented by Marketing implicated that the remote control design was expected to be more stylish and less complicated. Project Manager added that an ideal model would be for TV only and have a corporate logo incorporated. To meet the requirements above, Industrial Designer recommended a touch screen panel. Marketing suggested that the remote control size could be adjusted due to physical differences among international users. The team gave up speech recognition, for it would cost a lot. An alarm would be incorporated for detection in case the remote control was lost in the house.","Marketing presented the market research which was conducted by the usability lab, and shared some findings. First, users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls. Second, most people only use ten percent of the buttons. The biggest frustrations that people found were that remote controls were often lost and it took much time to learn to"
"The market research implicated that users' biggest frustration was their failure in finding the remote control once it was lost in the house. To solve the problem, Industrial Designer suggested that a button could be added on the TV; when the user pressed the button, the remote control would beep to let the user know its location. Meanwhile, such a solution would be within budget.","When discussing the market research, Marketing mentioned that 50% of users were frustrated by often losing the remote control. Industrial Designer suggested adding an alarm on the remote control so that users could find it easily. The alarm could beep or flash a signal when lost.

"Industrial Designer was inspired by the design of Xbox and gave an example of Japanese people's small hands compared to the big controller. Out of ergonomic considerations, Industrial Designer encouraged the team to notice the physical differences among users all over the world when deciding the remote control size.","Industrial Designer mentioned that Xbox had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically too big. The reason was that Japanese people generally have smaller hands. Therefore, ergonomics should be taken into consideration when designing the remote control. Users Interface agreed and suggested that a touch screen could"
"Overall, the model style was expected to be trendy and appealing. Marketing and Project Manager agreed on User Interface's design of a flip-screen. Marketing also hoped that the remote control would be slightly curved. User Interface added that the remote control would curl up to users' hands so that their thumbs did not have to press. The corporate logo would be put in the corner. The model would be made of lightweight plastic with a smooth bottom and a nice scallop shell exterior.","The remote control would be in a trendy shape, but not in a big box style or a tiny size. Also, it should be slightly curved and be able to reduce the repetitive strain injury. Besides, the logo of the company would be incorporated into the design of the product.

"Barry Hughes first stated that children had fewer rights than adults and therefore the law should be enforced to defend physical assault. As such social behavior was not available now, the law should change to reflect that. The discussion then turned to talk about the legal framework and its prosecution.","Barry Hughes argued that the law should reflect contemporary society and the law was evolutionary in nature. He believed that there was a need to bring the law up to date. The law at present was focused on protecting children from physical assault, but the implementation of the law was unclear. He proposed to remove the defense for reasonable punishment"
"Barry thought that the legal framework would make things clearer for parents and professionals. But when it came to prosecuting, there was a degree of confusion and some cases were in the grey areas.","Barry Hughes argued that there had been a range of laws created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provided for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young"

"Barry Hughes indicated that the Bill would impact England and their people, although it needed a period. Moreover, Barry thought there was no cross-border issue from the potential legislation, and the draft changing to CPS guidance would not be helpful for scrutinisers to decide on the law in Wales.","Dawn Bowden AM asked about the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales, for instance, the removal of the defense would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England. And they also discussed the extent to which CPS guidance would need to be updated to reflect"
"Barry Hughes concluded two kinds of implications. First, the Bill would raise awareness for people from England who travel to Wales. Second, people in other areas might reflect on this defense as they did to the drink driving limit in Scotland.","First, more cases would pass the evidential stage in Wales than in England, because the defense would still apply there. This would raise issues in terms of the awareness of criminal offending for people from England who traveled to Wales. Second, there had already been a certain degree of divergence of laws between Scotland and Wales, which"

"Barry Hughes introduced their cooperated organizations the National Police Chiefs' Council and their work on the out-of-court disposals. Then, Hughes and Vikki Howells talked about the possibility of creating a body of out-of-court disposals specific to the Bill. Lastly, there was a short discussion about the duty around awareness raising.",The Welsh Government are undertaking work with the National Police Chiefs' Council to explore the possibility of a greater use of out-of-court disposals in Wales. The CPS are responsible for deciding whether a case should be prosecuted or whether an out-of-court disposal should be sufficient. The Government can create an infrastructure that
The National Police Chiefs' Council was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals.,"The National Police Chiefs' Council had been working with the CPS on how to better the out-of-court disposals. There had been a great range of out-of-court disposals, and it would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved."
"Barry Hughes thought that the infrastructure can be built for a range of out-of-court disposals. It might be built by the Welsh Government, the police, and crime commissioners.","The Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill was limited, but Wales could build an infrastructure that provided a range of out-of-court disposals. The Bill could direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that. It was more likely that people would be pointed in that direction"
"Barry Hughes explained a number of unintended consequences questioned. The first one was about the isolated incidences in Wales, and the second came to the targets in terms of performance measure. The following concerns included malicious reporting, the European convention on human rights, low numbers of prosecutions, and a shortage of registered intermediaries.","Sian Gwenllian AM questioned whether someone living in Wales who could not use the reasonable punishment defense would have different life prospects compared to those people in England, who would be able to use that defense. Barry Hughes explained that if someone in Wales was convicted, they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in"
"Barry Hughes stated that they did not have targets and only prosecuted with reasonable prospects.

"The group decided that the product would have a low level chip, one button with LCD, a scroll wheel with a push button on it, a battery in the base, a single curve, and solar cells and it would be plastic instead of wooden so that the costs were 12.5 Euros which was within the budget. Furthermore, they came up with some new ideas about future products, such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable TV that followed the trend and people's moods.","The industrial designer introduced the components of the remote control including the chip, LCD button, battery and solar cell. The team further discussed about the functions of different parts of the remote control. In the discussion of cost calculation, the team members should have a look at the financial view.

"Although solar cell was the most expensive part of the whole product, it still played a crucial role in making the controller technologically innovative. Plus, it would be interesting for their marketing team to make a lot of advertisements to sell it.","Although the solar cells were the most expensive part, the marketing team believed that they could make a lot of advertisement concerning the cells and gain profits. Also, the group agreed that the product would be technologically innovative with the incorporation of the solar cells. Therefore, the group decided to keep the solar cells."
"The marketing thought they should not trust too much the trend because it wouldn't last long - fruits and vegetables were in fashion this year but maybe next year it would be insects. However, the industrial designer believed it was good to follow the flow now and then since electronic devices were not long life products: if people changed, the product appearance should change as well.","The marketing suggested making fruit-shaped TVs because it was a trend at the time, but he doubted that the trend would last for a long time. In addition, he thought that the trend of fruit was not suitable for TV, whose life expectancy was relatively long. The industrial designer, however, believed that following the trend"

The VAD neural net had twelve times nine inputs and two outputs. The system had improved significantly. It added some latency but the team could potentially run it in parallel.,The team was making progress on reducing latency. One hundred and seventy milliseconds was the new target.

The team thought that they could reduce this latency by using a smaller window for the delta. They also wanted
The professor wanted to know how much latency the VAD was adding to the model. The professor thought that the process could work in parallel. The professor informed the team that the max latency was unknown.,The professor was trying to understand how much time each component in the pipeline took. He was concerned that the VAD was adding too much latency. The professor thought that some of the delays were due to having a large filter length and expressed that smaller filter lengths could result in lower latency. He also thought that some of the

"When User Interface asked the group how to make the spongy remote, Marketing thought about changeable fronts and some basic colour fronts because a fancy look was the most important thing for remote control. So they could make five different fronts to start with. Marketing also mentioned that it could be round, different from a normal remote control.","When presenting the market trend, Marketing mentioned that a fancy look was the most important thing for remote control and proposed to use changeable fronts and extraordinary shapes like a sponge to attract customers. The reason for the shape design was that customers expected technological innovation. Marketing also suggested the use of speech recognition technology. As for the material,"
User Interface recommended the speech recognition when Marketing asked how to do with technological innovation because User Interface knew from the technology department that they had done research about it and recommended using speech.

He was adding to PhD F's remarks on students in the team doing a similar thing.","The professor recalled a workshop where the group had access to twenty-five machines and was experimenting with distributing tasks among them. The experiment proved to be less efficient than anticipated, as the network became saturated. The professor also noted that such a setup might create unfair delays for other users."
The team was doing spectral subtraction with both scaling and GGT bins. There were pros and cons to both approaches. The professor suggested a simple spectral subtraction followed by a KL transformation. He also suggested using JRASTRA's technique which relied on adding some noise to get rid of noise. The team also suggested VTS techniques.,"The team was interested in performing spectral subtraction in the mel domain but was unsure whether to do so before or after frame dropping. Additionally, they wanted to investigate techniques to deal with colored noise. The Vector Taylor Series was a possible solution."
"PhD D brought up a VTS technique to do voice-unvoice which was developed by Jose Carlos Segura, who is a person from Grenada. The professor did not know him, but the inspiration for the VTS had come from CMU.",The team mentioned that they had met someone in Grenada who was working on the implementation of VTS techniques. The person was Jose Carlos Segura. The team was collaborating with him and another person in Lucent on some work.
"The professor could not see the advantage in combining the Wiener filter and the subspace. He later understood it would be a simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform, followed by a Wiener filter.","The professor was ignorant about how the Wiener filter worked. He was also skeptical about whether the multi-band solution worked well with noise. His solution involved a cascade of two systems: spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform and a Wiener filter. The professor did not think that one should orthogonalize if the features were noisy"
"Project Manager stated the meeting topic on function design. Firstly, Marketing concluded a study on user needs, including buttons for channel selection according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button, and suggested targeting on the nineteen to thirty-five years old age group to design functions. Next, User Interface presented on the technical effect on what functions users need and how to make the best functions for users. Then, Industrial Designer presented the working design, including input a channel or volume setting and output the location function to the television.","The Marketing's research showed that customers and users don't like the way remote controls looked, the way they felt, and they didn't match their operating behaviour. The most important buttons were those to do with channel selection, teletext, volume, and power. Other buttons such as settings were not important."
"At the first beginning of the discussion, Industrial Designer mentioned that it would be easy to implement something like a buzzer to trace the remote location. Project Manager suggested a two-part package - on one hand, users could click the button on the TV to send out the signal; on the other hand, the remote base could beep probably so that users could know where the remote control has gone.","The group first agreed to add a finder button for the remote control. Since the power source was an issue, the group decided to make this function a separate base, which could be sold separately. The group then discussed the light and the beep for the call button. The group ultimately agreed to have the beep since it was"
"Marketing suggested the speech recognition design is for user groups aged from nineteen to thirty-five. Industrial Designer supplemented the feature design that if the TV is on and somebody says like one, then the TV would switch itself to channel one. However, Project Manager illustrated that considering the budget, to have the speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be expensive. And this ended up was commonly agreed by other group mates.","Industrial Designer thought speech recognition was hard to programme and get easily confused by sounds from TV. Project Manager also pointed out that adding speech recognition might be too pricey. As a result, the group agreed not to go for this feature. Instead, they decided to focus on the fancy look and feel of the remote. One way"
Project Manager mentioned that the group needed to decide on the VCR capabilities and answered Industrial Designer's question on whether VCRs were the same across the world. So Industrial Designer suggested a whole different set of buttons for individual VCRs. Project Manager suggested DVD type if considering the target group as young professionals and teenagers.,"The group discussed whether the remote control should have VCR capabilities. Project Manager thought the remote control should target DVD players, which is the technology these days. User Interface suggested that it should not be a problem to reduce the number of buttons and make the remote control compatible with different devices. Marketing thought they should design the channels"
"Marketing proposed that the fancy look and feel were more important than the functionality of the product. The fruit and vegetable theme was the current trend, and marketing himself preferred fruits to vegetables. Therefore, how spongy the material could be should be taken into consideration when choosing the materials. The potential materials to accomplish the fruit and vegetable theme could be a sort of rubber, which was used in the stress balls. The alternative option was to use a cover for it, and choose a colour that fits one's sitting room.",The group was looking for the current trends and fancy elements to apply on the remote. Marketing announced that the fruit and vegetable theme was the current trend and proposed to use a spongy feel for the remote. The group discussed whether to use technology-based innovations or simply stick to the basic function. They also debated on the material
"Industrial Designer thought some parts needed custom design, and other parts should just use standard. For example, the case needed custom design to protect the remote and the locator, and the circuit board needed custom design as well, while the buttons and the wheels, radio sender and receiver were all standard parts. In addition, beeper or other noise things were needed as well for locating the remote. Rubber, plastic, wood and titanium were options of materials, but better not titanium. Regular chips were required if the iPod-style wheel button was used.","The Industrial Designer had been looking at the component design by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting.

Even though they could not find an exact price for it, it would not be more expensive than a chip.","The group first considered whether to use batteries, solar power or a dynamo. The solar power could not be used with the rubber case. The group selected the battery as their first option. Although the dynamo was interesting, it could only be used outdoors. Therefore, the group agreed to use batteries. They next had to decide"
"Industrial Designer preferred battery. Industrial Designer was not very familiar with dynamo. Wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power were all possible, but solar power would not be available with the rubber case.","The Industrial Designer explained to the team that the options of energy sources included batteries, solar power and a dynamo.

"They all agreed that most employers did not have a clear understanding of what Welsh bac means or what it includes, which was a big problem not only for employers, but also for parents and young people. Though some small engaged employers did understand it, the vast majority focused more on running the business without a clear understanding.","Dafydd Evans thought most people, including employers, didn't understand what the Welsh bac meant or included. He considered the skills challenge certificate was a better title that people could relate to. Nick Brazil questioned the quality of skills of the graduates with a baccalaureate and pointed out that few employers mentioned the baccalaureate when"
"Ed Evans thought employers did not understand it, but they would appreciate it if they do. This was particularly true for his own sector, the civil engineering sector, and particularly contracting sector. Because pupils usually did not have a very strong academic background in this sector, and Welsh bac gave them the opportunity to not pursue that much of academic, but tested them in terms of the challenges. Therefore, the growth of the Welsh bac would be valued at least for this sector.","When discussing the potential of the Welsh baccalaureate, Sian Gwenllian AM asked Ed Evans about his opinion as an organization and he responded that he had a lot of views on this. He considered that employers did not understand the value of the baccalaureate. However, if they did, they would appreciate this because for"
"They proposed that the voice of employers should be a key part of reviewing the qualification. Instead of colleges or qualifications boards doing this, employers themselves should do this qualification, which accorded to the vision of the Welsh baccalaureate, to improve skills for employment. They really should join employers and schools and education facilities together more in the future.",The first idea was to review the qualification and invite the voice of employers to participate in it so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills would have more of a role within that qualification. The second idea was to carry on with the current method of introducing social value-type contracts in the sector to connect employers and schools or education facilities
"One thing needing to be cleared was that Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications, but not just one qualification. To develop the employability skills was obviously a key part of it, but not all of it. It obviously worked well to help prepare for employment, but was not for everyone, because some people had to do the other things. It helped prepare some people, such as the A level students for university, but did not help health and social care people become more skilled and employable.","Dafydd Evans thought there were a number of priorities, and one of the problems was that they had a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they needed to resit their GCSEs in maths, English and Welsh. It was a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a C grade in"
"Kay Martin agreed with other people's opinion. They tried their best to help learners to develop skills and employable people. Welsh bac worked well for preparing employment for some people, but not for everybody. Because some people came to school with very few GCSAs, or were lacking literacy or numeracy skills. Kay Martin thought this needed to be reviewed, to look at how they could actually make skilled and employable people.","The job in the college was to develop skills and employable people, and they used every tool in their box to do that. The Welsh bac worked well for some people, but it was not for everyone. Some people needed to do other things. For example, some people coming from schools, some of them with very"
"Dafydd Evans though that one of the problems was that there were a number of priorities. For example, there were a number of students who needed to resit their GCSE. It was important for everybody to get a C grade in those core subjects, but that would take some time from them teaching young people. Therefore, there were fewer and fewer doing level 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they were resitting their GCSEs. Nick Brazil added that Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications, and developing the employment was one of the key parts, but not all of it.","Dafydd Evans thought that there was no room for everything in the curriculum somehow—no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. At present, they had given priority to GCSE resits rather than doing the Welsh bac. While"

"They thought that a lot of skills and challenges that were done within the Welsh bac were very similar with the vocational qualification. Therefore, a number of those staff had already got those skills. Besides, for the vocational lecturers to do that, they had invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac and got positive outcomes of the Welsh bac, which had been an intensive staff development process.","Dafydd Evans was not assured in terms of introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac, for it had been found that vocational lecturers had actually taken the Welsh bac on board and put it in the context of the sports curriculum.

"Kirsty Williams AM suggested that Welsh Government had always been big supporters of WISERD (WalesInstitute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods). More research into Welsh education would always be needed. As a Government, all aspects of concerns of Welsh education should be taken into consideration as the government was planning the new curriculum. For instance,  empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teached their children actually gave the government an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of the school children than what they had at the moment.","Kirsty believed that there was no evidence that the curriculum would exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils. The four enabling purposes of the curriculum were to empower teachers to be more flexible in teaching, to have high expectation of all pupils, to deliver a curriculum within the school setting, and to take into consideration of the"

Also, professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes was an alert to the Welsh government. Steve Davies added that one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content and it could be a fit for the new curriculum.","Scotland was not a copycat of Wales' curriculum, but it was always useful to reflect on how other systems had undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that had arisen.

Also it was aimed at a national level, but to start with, schools would be assessed individually.","The funding would be given to each school and the amount was the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution.

It is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output. This makes the structure more flexible in terms of coding feature-layer probabilities. ,"Grad B thought that a pain could be caused to set up the probabilities for a complicated structure. So Grad B suggested adding a middle layer that contained features that had been extracted from the communication. The thinking behind this was to figure out the hidden variables like the concept of whether someone was on a tour, running an errand,"
"The next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters. Although, in theory, traditional AI plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions, the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task. ","The team would proceed to extract more fine-grained temporal relations and discourse markers from the meeting data. Additionally, they planned to perform a more in-depth analysis of the types of features that could be useful for modeling the dynamics of conversations."
"There was a demonstration of the structure and the function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task. The features nodes include things like prosody, discourse, verb choice, ""landmark-iness"" of a building, time of day and whether the admission fee was discussed.","The group had decided that for modeling intentionality, they would include features related to the prosody, the discourse, the verb choice, the ""landmark-iness"" of a building, and whether someone was a business person, a tourist, or unknown. They also wanted to include time of day and whether someone was open"
"The values these nodes take feed into the middle layer nodes identified as hidden variables of the user/device interaction, such as whether the user is on tour, running an errand or in a hurry. These, in turn, help infer whether the user wants to see, enter or simply approach a building.","The team thought that the middle layer would help with the extraction of hidden variables, such as whether someone was on a tour, running an errand, or in a hurry. The idea was that people in a hurry would be less likely to want to view things and more likely to use a place as a navigational point to go"
"SmartKom, although it does not code for intentions as specified in this task, provides a model of the discourse, which can be useful for the detection of features through querying and anaphora resolution.

"The committee admitted that the funding issues brought more pressure on schools, especially after the new Act, for they would have to spend more in the light of it. It was pointed out that the government had not noticed the staff in the PRU, who required training.

Sharon thought that there was pressure on the system because of the new Act that placed more pressure on the schools. And according to David, the same situation happened in England, and as a consequence, the local authorities at one"
"David Hopkins agreed with Sharon Davies that the new Act would exert more pressure on schools. However, he denied that the levels of the delegation would have any impact. Meanwhile, he suggested that it would be better for the schools' headmasters and local authorities to look at the new Act more constructively, for it would be beneficial for the post-16 sector.","There had been big issues around tribunals, to the point that local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again. Also, the levels of delegation had any impact on the issue. It was difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies would react to this whole area"
"David Hopkins did not think that the delegation levels were not high enough in most authority areas. Instead, he thought they had got agreements with the government to make sure that enough money was devolved to school. The true decisive factor was the narrow measure at the end of Stage 4 that drove the headmasters to exclude students or put them into another school.","First, the very narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment had put pressure on some schools.

"There had been improvements in the networking within the PRU, for they had national meetings on a regular basis, which could lead to a better sharing of practice. The PRU was planning to provide teachers with professional training. On the transition arrangement, the PRU was building a brand new provision in Swansea. The PRU would support students through a part-time timetable back into school. Besides, the support would not stop as soon as the students returned to school; the reduction of support would be managed.","The networking within the PRU had improved a lot and the EOTAS group met regionally as well.

It was much more difficult to get them back into mainstream. Then, they would be looking more at how to transit into further education and colleges and so on.

"Sharon Davies recommended the team-around-the-family approach to ensure what was needed for learners to go back into school, as well as what the school could provide. She pointed out the importance of the whole package of support, which not only surrounded the learners but also their families. In addition, she gave an example of the PRU in Oxford who built the partnership between the school and the PRU student to demonstrate the responsibility of schools and the significance of school participation.","The solution Sharon Davies recommended was to adopt a PRU model a few years ago, and primary headteachers were looking at different models at conferences. Under this model, the local authority had a PRU, and they had discussions with their secondary schools about whether to get rid of the PRU as such and give the money"
One of the advantages was that youngsters' voice could be heard in time if they showed the willingness to go back into school; the framework offered the excluded learners a cooling-off period. The disadvantage was mainly some individual schools' lack of capacity to organize and offer additional training. Monitor and evaluation systems of the EOTAS provision were supposed to be set up to ensure the education quality.,"The first reason was about the capacity. Generally, there were not enough spaces in some cases, some year groups and so on. The second was about the quality of the staff. They were managing those pressures in their own provision whilst they were going out and observed through a provision framework to make sure that the provision was appropriate"
"Sharon Davies expressed her strong objection to the exclusions caused by tuition or safeguarding. She pointed out that the difficulty with home tuition was the limited access the local authority could get into the families. The quality of home tuition was difficult to assure, unless the families invited them there, which was a really rare situation. All in all, the role of local authorities was restricted in this aspect.","Sharon Davies supposed that the difficulty with home tuition was that as a local authority, they were restricted on how much access they got into the home. Therefore, it was really difficult then to quality assure, because unless the families invited them in there was very little. They were restricted in that respect."
"The intuition in a private setting was supposed to follow a restricted timetable, for no matter for what reason the students' need cannot be met at school, the PRU staff ought to provide them with some education. Besides, the education provided should be different from the education provided by agency staff, who merely offered a few hours' provision or the service offered by local libraries.",The staff who provided some education for those students who couldn't meet in a school or in approved provision worked for the local authority. The local authorities were not using agency staff. The question was about other forms of provisions and how to assure those. The answer was that it would be more difficult to assure those.
PRU was supposed to collaborate with schools to arrange special curriculums to meet the students' special needs. This not only had something to do with finance but was also related to the recruitment of professional staff. The training for special education ought to be included in the professional training system.,The first challenge was to ensure that EOTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum. The quality assurance took into account what the pupil was receiving. And it was agreed that there should be more collaboration between the PRUs and the schools. The second challenge was the shortage of professional staff. It was hoped that
"Dawn Bowden pointed out that there were a very small number of staff members working in the provision area, and the capacity for them to access professional training was limited. Sharon Davies agreed and added that though the situation had been bettered by the Internet technology, there was still not much opportunity for the ones who desired to specialize in the area.","Dawn Bowden AM suggested that local authorities could encourage specialist teachers and educational psychologists to share expertise with independent providers of EOTAS. However, Nick Williams pointed out that it is difficult to manage the class because of the demands, so it is not an easy conundrum. The solution, as Dawn Bowden AM suggested, is"

That meant a complicated program delivered by the government that left many people behind, and more importantly, there was no action reacting to it. So Ms. Jenny Kwan called for a fixation for this gap and proposed that matching funding and adequate housing should be arranged for those who were affected.","Ms. Kwan meant that the government had decided to implement a complicated program to help people with disabilities and the single parents with four school-age children lost their spousal and child support due to COVID-19.

"As one of the highest risk populations, the elderly's costs had gone up. Many seniors who were facing extra dispensing fees were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic. It was so important that the government be there to support them. The government announced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for seniors eligible for GIS. This meant there would be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time.

"Since Quebec was Canada's biggest producer of hydroelectricity, renewable energy sharing through an energy corridor was very essential for different areas in Canada. And as a hard-hit sector, tourism needed much support from the Canadian government. The government was going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions would be ready when the economy reopened. When it came to the green economy, the government now gave priority to the virus and making through this disaster. Also, they paid much attention to the small businesses and carried out measures to help them out.","Jacques Gourde questioned about the government's support for Canada's biggest producer of hydroelectricity, which is a renewable energy that seemed to be a tough sell west of Quebec. He also asked about the government's commitment to granting import permits under CUSMA to Canada's dairy processors, not retailers directly."

With respect to rent support, they were encouraging landlords to support this measure. Obviously, rent and landlord-tenant relations were under provincial jurisdiction. At every opportunity Hon. Bill Morneau talked to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there. They would continue to support small businesses. It allowed for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75% of the rent.

"During the pandemic, the lobster fishery was being negatively affected and was facing losses of up to 95% of its Asian markets. Many fishermen had their wives, their sons, their uncles or their fathers working for them, and sometimes it was the whole family on the boat. Moreover, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals were having to deal with considerable losses of income. As for oil and gas, western Canada oil storage is under extreme pressure. If thermal projects such as SAGD are shut down, those facilities could be lost forever. The oil and gas sector was suffering through two crises --COVID and the effects of a global price war.","The opposition party supposed that the government's fund of 62.5 million dollars for the fishing industry was not enough, and the actual fund should be more than 100 million dollars.

"The oil and gas industry was under severe strain. Over the past number of years, they had seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down. The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the Bill C-69, which would prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry. These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels. To compound Alberta's economic problems, we have an international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a huge drop in demand for oil.","Mr. David Yurdiga (Fort McMurrayCold Lake, CPC) introduced that the oil and gas industry was under severe strain.

"The project manager put forward that the speech recognition wouldn't work when several persons wanted to change the channel at the same time, and the cost would surely rise if adding the two technologies. In response to that, the user interface designer said they would just cooperate with some research institute and the vocabulary was limited, so it wouldn't cost much. Then the project manager posed the language problem. The user interface designer answered they would have some language adaptations so the product could be used by people from all countries. Finally, there were still problems with the microphone and camera that were necessary for the two technologies.","The user interface designer suggested adding voice recognition and gesture recognition to the remote control, enabling users to interact with the TV without touching it.

In addition, he thought it would be challenging to achieve"
"The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects —material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood instead of plastic to make the controller more fashionable and having buttons with LCD so that people could see the controller in dark. In terms of the alimentation, it would be good to have both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation. Considering that the product was supposed to be easy to use, the industrial designer thought some low level chip would be enough, which was agreed by the group.","The remote control could be made of wood, plastic or other materials. Solar energy could be used as an alternative source of power. In terms of the circuit board, it could be cheap and low-level. For the button, LCD buttons could be used as they were more fashionable and practical. A touch screen could also"

"Marketing set the criteria for evaluation. The group gave two points on the fancy look and feel, three points on the ease of use and learnable, and two points on technological innovation because the group thought new features were not all extraordinary. Besides, they gave two points on the target market trend which said that the products with fruit and vegetables in different colors might be popular. Lastly, they gave high marks on the room for creativity and leadership.","The team agreed on most of the features of the product, but some of the details needed to be negotiated.

Project Manager thought the second layer of the remote was not easy to learn but Industrial Designer responded that users would not need to pay attention to that part. The group reached a consensus that the scroll wheel was much better than average. So they gave a two on this criterion.,"Project Manager thought the remote control was easy to use as well as learnable, since it contained scroll wheels and speech functions.

"Industrial Designer explained that TA11835 is a chip used in pretty much every remote control to send out standard signals based on the input. On the other hand, most current remotes use a silicone printed circuit board (PCB board) which connects the circuits so that the messages would be sent to the chip. The size should be decided as the board can be custom made.",Industrial Designer explained that the circuit board was made of silicone and was very flexible. The switches were connected to the LED and could be in various sizes. The size of the PCB could also be changed according to the number of buttons. The team would also need to consider the type of chip to use in the remote control.
"Standard AA and AAA are bulky but the cheapest. Dynamo and dual charging with normal batteries and solar charging take up too much space. Solar charging is the second cheapest but not resistant to dropping. Also, Project Manager believed it would limit the market. Kinetic charging is small and portable but market research should be done first. No rechargeable battery options were available. The remote could have a standby mode and the lights behind the buttons would be switched off after five or ten seconds when not in use.","The team first considered whether to use rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries.

"In order to make a satisfying profit, the group had to set their price at 25 euros, which was relatively high. For fear that the higher price would lead to fewer consumers, they decided to make it a universal remote control, being able to function on different TVs. The group also planned to add a touchscreen onto the remote control and even include some games for children. What’s more, they paid some attention to the energy source, whether it should be a rechargeable one or just use normal batteries.",The first thing to be discussed was whether it would be universal. Marketing hoped it could be designed as a universal remote control. Then the group members voiced out their experiences with remote control. They found that the remote control with a touchscreen was always fragile and expensive. So they gave up this idea and decided to use a rechargeable
"When discussing the remote control, the group tried to set the price at 25 euros, which was relatively high, at least compared to the existing ones. For fear that such a high price would lose their potential consumers, the Project Manager decided to aim their product at a universal one. According to the Project Manager, only by making it a universal remote control and adding other unique characters could it attract more consumers, then eventually reaching their profit expectation.","The Project Manager mentioned that they had to make a profit of fifty million Euros, so they had to use a big market in Europe and sell a lot of these remote controls. The market range included apart from television, other devices as well. The price of each remote control was twenty-five Euros, and the production cost"
"When discussing adding several advanced techniques onto the remote control to make it more unique, the Industrial Design put forward to using the touchscreen. Notwithstanding the merits of the touchscreen, for instance, a touch screen would make the remote control easier and smaller, the Marketing did not agree to do so just because in that case they would be beyond the budget.","The Industrial Design suggested adding a small touch screen on the remote control to make it easy and small. However, the Project Manager thought that there were already buttons on it, so a touchscreen was unnecessary. Also, the User Interface pointed out that a touchscreen was too expensive. The Marketing agreed with the User Interface. Therefore,"
"When discussing the conceptual design of the remote control, the group noticed that the energy source was also a problem worth concern. The Industrial Design proposed to make it rechargeable at first, but because of their limited budget, he had to change his idea. The Industrial Design then put forward to setting a station at home or perhaps just using normal batteries to run the remote control, both of which would be feasible.","Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control could be put in a rechargeable station so that users could recharge it whenever the battery was low. This would do away with the need to change batteries and thus save the cost of the remote control. Besides, a rechargeable station could help people find the remote control whenever they lost it.

The basic options could be on the top and other options could be on
"When discussing the button layout, the User Interface drew a draft to show how to make the remote control more unique and attractive. He suggested to put several essential and useful buttons together in the same place, and others might be scattered on the remote control, on all of which there would be clear logos. As long as the button layout was user-friendly enough, the User Interface thought it did not really matter much where the buttons would be.","The User Interface suggested that the on-off button must be on the top, and the TV channels and volume buttons should be placed obviously. For the rest of the buttons, as long as they had clear icons, it didn't matter where they were. In addition, the remote control could be made special, but"
Using multiple languages led to more diversity which potentially hindered the model performance. The professor was skeptical about discussing the results since they had not received any good ones so far.,"The team was not sure whether the multi-lingual models trained on digits with the same label would perform worse than the models trained on a single language. Results from TIMIT showed that it did not make a significant difference. However, the team speculated that there might be some hidden factors, like the overlap between the languages,"
"PhD D explained that the multilingual model, trained on French, Spanish, and English, was trained with higher frame rates. It has slightly poorer results when delta was not used. All in all, the addition of English did not seem to help the model.","PhD D explained that the multilingual nets were trained on features without the second derivative but with increased frame numbers. And, the performance of the models was slightly worse when they didn't use the second derivative, but the difference was not that big. Also, MF, MS and ME stood for Multi-French, Multi-"
The professor thought that the model did not get hurt that much because of the removal of English. He also thought it would be worthwhile to train on one language and test on another.,"The professor thought that it was not so much about the cross-language problem, but rather the type of speech. He was asking what exactly was done to Finnish in order to understand what was truly being tested. He wanted to know if it was just a matter of language or something more. He thought that the results may"
"The team discussed the size of the neural net, which was just a simple net. At the time, it had 27 outputs, but the professor recommended that they use a larger net, with perhaps more features. They discussed the effect that removing silent frames could have on the model. The professor recommended having a bigger hidden layer, though he did not think that would substantially improve performance. Currently, however, the team was facing computational limitations.","The team was preparing to perform experiments with a smaller number of classes and broader categories. They had trained a net with 27 classes and were planning to test its performance. Additionally, they were working on feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to manage the complexity of the models."
"The team was concerned about the availability of computational resources. The Professor informed them that they had received two 550 megahertz processors by IBM. Though, they were originally expecting eight 800 megahertz processors.","The team had a small IBM computer with slots for eight processors. They had only purchased two processors, though, so they were waiting on more. Additionally, the team was waiting for IBM to donate some processors."
The team talked about delays when discussing the removal of frames that were silent. This could possibly improve model performance at the cost of a small delay.,"The professor thought that the model might be within the boundary of the delay, while PhD A thought that it would definitely introduce some delay. PhD C and PhD E agreed with the professor. The team discussed the difference between TLDA and SLDA, but this did not lead to a conclusion on whether the delay was within the"
"Industrial Designer desired to integrate remote controls for different appliances into one. Marketing pointed out that such integration would lead to too many buttons, which was not user-friendly enough. Instead, Marketing suggested that a menu display should be incorporated. Project Manager and User Interface agreed and added that basic buttons could remain. User Interface and Industrial Designer refused the flip top, however, for it costs a lot. The team temporarily chose lightweight plastic to be the material.","Project Manager proposed to design the remote control with a simple and intuitive interface, without a lot of tiny buttons. Marketing suggested that the remote control should be user-friendly to all age groups. User Interface suggested taking the design of the mobile phone into consideration, with a flip function, a built-in LCD screen and a"
Marketing believed that most of the market would want convenient channel browsing and volume adjustment features instead of any tampering or programming with too many buttons. User Interface agreed with the simplification of symbols. The team came up with a menu display to make the remote more user-friendly.,"When discussing the style and design of the remote control, the group found that too many buttons might complicate the usage. Thus, they decided to take a simpler style and design, and to incorporate a menu display like a mobile phone. In this way, new functions can be added without making the remote control too complicated. Also"
"Industrial Designer initially worried about the replacement of buttons. Industrial Designer was soon convinced by Marketing that the age gap was a problem regardless of any design modifications and insisted on the incorporation of a menu display, however.","Industrial Designer thought that as long as the remote control was self-intuitive and users could figure out what everything was doing, the older generation could use it. He cited the example of his grandfather, who was good at using teletext. In addition, he pointed out that the remote control menu should be simple and clear,"
Industrial Designer was uncertain about whether the remote could look fashionable with plastic at first. Marketing and Project Manager exemplified other remote controls to make Industrial Designer believe that silver plastic could look smart.,"Marketing thought that they could make the remote control look more fashionable and stylish by using metal. However, in response to this proposal, Industrial Designer pointed out that it is also possible to achieve a good appearance by using plastic, and plastic would be much cheaper. The other advantage of plastic is that it can be easily molded and"
"Project Manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 Euros, considering the 12.5-Euro production cost. The profit aim for the team would be 50 million Euros in the first year. The market range would be international and over all age groups.","The remote control would be priced at 25 Euros, or 17.5 pounds. The profit aim for the first year is 50 million Euros. The production cost would be 12.5 Euros. Compared with the 20 pound price of the same kind of remote control at present,"
"Project Manager hoped to make the market range international, covering all age groups, instead of focusing solely on the business market. Project Manager highlighted that the team should not worry about the language differences and the big target group would be achievable.",Marketing proposed to target the international market and said that the remote control was to be made accessible and usable by all age groups. Project Manager agreed and added that the key to success would not be focusing on different languages but on making the remote control user-friendly to everyone. Marketing nodded in agreement. With the price issue settled
