Summarize the discussion about the efficacy of the law.|Barry Hughes first stated that children had fewer rights than adults and therefore the law should be enforced to defend physical assault. As such social behavior was not available now, the law should change to reflect that. The discussion then turned to talk about the legal framework and its prosecution.|"[""Barry Hughes: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature.

Meeting Transcript:
Barry Hughes: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that.
Dawn Bowden AM: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales—well, and in England, actually, across the border—will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law?
Barry Hughes: Not as of the present day. Give us a chance. [Laughter.]
Dawn Bowden AM: But you would expect that to be something you would—
Barry Hughes: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. So, actually, I'm probably being unfair to myself. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes?
Dawn Bowden AM: That's helpful, thank you. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation.
Barry Hughes: In addition to those that I've mentioned, probably not. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. That's fine. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: I've got a supplementary from Suzy, and then Siân.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. I was going to ask this question later, but I think it fits in—. I've forgotten what I was going to ask; this is terrible. Oh no, that's right—obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision?
Barry Hughes: Fit for purpose, yes.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes. Okay, that's great. Bear with me a second—thank you very much—in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this?

But there isn't anything significant. There's nothing that will impact upon our performance as the public prosecution service in that time.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this.
Barry Hughes: Certainly. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will—.

Summarize the discussion about out-of-court disposals.|Barry Hughes introduced their cooperated organizations the National Police Chiefs' Council and their work on the out-of-court disposals. Then, Hughes and Vikki Howells talked about the possibility of creating a body of out-of-court disposals specific to the Bill. Lastly, there was a short discussion about the duty around awareness raising.|"['Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Vikki.', ""Vikki Howells AM: Thank you. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option?"", ""Barry Hughes: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. Their lead is deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. Any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something—. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say—for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth—we\xa0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\xa0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility—that will fall to the police—but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. Does that help?"", ""Barry Hughes: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved—the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction."", ""Barry Hughes: Somewhere within Wales—Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. It may be that the police and crime commissioners use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. I'm not the right person to answer that question."", 'Vikki Howells AM: Okay. Thank you, Chair.', ""Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. There's no such duty proposed in this Bill. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales?"", ""Barry Hughes: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions."", ""Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example?"", ""Barry Hughes: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here—by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes—if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that.

Meeting Transcript:
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Vikki.
Vikki Howells AM: Thank you. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option?
Barry Hughes: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. Their lead is deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. Any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something—. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say—for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth—we  think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility—that will fall to the police—but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. Does that help?
Barry Hughes: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved—the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction.
Barry Hughes: Somewhere within Wales—Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. It may be that the police and crime commissioners use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. I'm not the right person to answer that question.
Vikki Howells AM: Okay. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. There's no such duty proposed in this Bill. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales?
Barry Hughes: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example?
Barry Hughes: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here—by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes—if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it.

Summarize the discussion about unintended consequences.|Barry Hughes explained a number of unintended consequences questioned. The first one was about the isolated incidences in Wales, and the second came to the targets in terms of performance measure. The following concerns included malicious reporting, the European convention on human rights, low numbers of prosecutions, and a shortage of registered intermediaries.|"[""Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence—would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence."", ""Barry Hughes: Yes. Okay. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted—so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution—. It may be—the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. We probably would end up prosecuting, because it's a relatively serious offence. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child—in circumstances that would not have happened in England—then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. But I think, along the road there, there would have been an element of choice."", 'Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident?', ""Barry Hughes: Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. They're likely to be very limited. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales—this was the review in 2007—it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales—and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally—you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest."", ""Barry Hughes: I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. In the CPS, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets—it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean."", 'Sian Gwenllian AM: What about—? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence?', ""Barry Hughes: I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. That disappeared some years ago. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. The police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. It's much less of an issue than it ever was—much."", ""Barry Hughes: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners—whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Regrettably, there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. I can see it potentially arising. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication."", 'Sian Gwenllian AM: Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law?', ""Barry Hughes: No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. And I can't think of anything else off the top of my head."", 'Sian Gwenllian AM: Finally from me, therefore—another issue, in a way—the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point.']"|"You are an assistant that answers questions about meeting transcripts.

What did Project Manager think of the call button suggested by User Interface?|The initial feature suggested by Marketing was easy to find and User Interface suggested a call button on the television. And Marketing wanted something that could vibrate or had a signal if it had no sound. However, they were not sure whether it is expensive to design it. So Project Manager suggested designing a magnet or portable phone based couch for the remote control, which people no need to walk over the TV to find it.|"['Marketing: Four million .

Marketing: Four million . And it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .
Industrial Designer: Oh , yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} It is a lot . Uh .

Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I was thinking that too .
Marketing: bec yeah {vocalsound} bec
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: I think we should design something that has like a {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} like somehow like you {disfmarker} I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I've always wanted that ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: so like {vocalsound} you can push a button on your T_V_ {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .
Project Manager: I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .

User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?
Marketing: And the other thing is {disfmarker}
User Interface: Bigger .
Marketing: Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Like Hand hand held size , yeah .
User Interface: Hand-sized .
Marketing: Yeah . I don't think you need a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Not not huge , but {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know .
User Interface: It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .
Marketing: No , it can't be , uh-uh .
Industrial Designer: No it really wouldn't be .
Project Manager: Huh .
User Interface: Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno {vocalsound}

Project Manager: Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap}
User Interface: I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I agree .

Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .

Project Manager: what do you call it {disfmarker}

Marketing: Because {disfmarker}

Marketing: Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote ,

Summarize the discussion about the remote control size.|Project Manager asked if the remote control needed to be made larger to avoid losing it. At the first beginning, User Interface suggested bigger, while Project Manager suggested a hand-sized device. Considering the light feature and putting noise on it, User Interface thought it would be feasible to make it mobile with a target price at 25 Euros.|"[""Marketing: but anyway I will do that .

Meeting Transcript:
Marketing: but anyway I will do that . Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {gap} Yeah . This cord's {disfmarker} {gap} Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet {vocalsound} . Uh {disfmarker} It's a pig .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? This is {disfmarker}
User Interface: And furry .
Project Manager: yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Textile {disfmarker} tactile , {vocalsound} tactile remote control .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Although {disfmarker} uh I'll just put there . Right .
User Interface: You're dragging a {disfmarker} you have a tail {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: {gap} Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . Sorry about that . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country {vocalsound} . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
User Interface: Sorry can you just say that {disfmarker} what's the {disfmarker} what are our price goals again ?
Project Manager: Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: How many should we sell then ? {vocalsound} Um , a lot ,
Project Manager: Anyone a mathematician ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: two two two million , {gap} two mi no , more f four million .
Marketing: Four million . And it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .
Industrial Designer: Oh , yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} It is a lot . Uh .
Project Manager: So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .
Marketing: Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I was thinking that too .
Marketing: bec yeah {vocalsound} bec
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: I think we should design something that has like a {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} like somehow like you {disfmarker} I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I've always wanted that ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: so like {vocalsound} you can push a button on your T_V_ {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .
Project Manager: I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .
Marketing: Yeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a {disfmarker} maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?
Marketing: And the other thing is {disfmarker}
User Interface: Bigger .
Marketing: Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Like Hand hand held size , yeah .
User Interface: Hand-sized .
Marketing: Yeah . I don't think you need a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Not not huge , but {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know .
User Interface: It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .
Marketing: No , it can't be , uh-uh .
Industrial Designer: No it really wouldn't be .
Project Manager: Huh .
User Interface: Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Like spaceship .
User Interface: . Yeah {vocalsound} . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: That would be really {disfmarker} I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop .
Project Manager: Little homing device . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Uh .
Project Manager: Okay . So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes .
Marketing: Oh dear .
Project Manager: Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap}
User Interface: I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I agree .
User Interface: 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .

What did Project Manager think of the cost constraints on the telly screen with the programming function?|Since User Interface initially suggested less button feature on the remote control, so Project Manager suggested a telly screen like what phones have. And User Interface mentioned about the master control in electronic houses. However, User Interface thought it is a bit expensive to create this feature, but Marketing mentioned the similar screen in phones is in the acceptable cost range. So, Project Manager agreed and suggested further discussion in the coming meeting.|"[""User Interface: I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them .

Project Manager: s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s

Project Manager: Right .
Marketing: But um {disfmarker}
User Interface: I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker}
Marketing: But yeah for sure . Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: is that what you mean ?
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Or like you h you see those you know people {disfmarker} I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those {disfmarker} these things that at their house you know {disfmarker} their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that {disfmarker} and it's like a hand held like {disfmarker} turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like {disfmarker} so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if {disfmarker} it must be {disfmarker} it would probably {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .
User Interface: Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true .
Project Manager: Yeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point {disfmarker} twelve fifty for {disfmarker} to actually make the device .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: Um but it's something to think about , yeah .
User Interface: Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah .
Project Manager: I mean we'll have to see how much that would be .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Or some {disfmarker} it i we can find out probably on the internet {vocalsound} how much it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker}

Industrial Designer: Yeah I think so .
Project Manager: yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The something , what is the U_I_ ?
Industrial Designer: User .
Project Manager: Yeah , what does it stand for again ?
User Interface: That's me . Uh , User Interface design .
Project Manager: User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w
User Interface: So technical function .
Industrial Designer: The working design is the structure .
Project Manager: Yeah , yeah .
User Interface: What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what {disfmarker}

Why did Project Manager suggest having a clip on the remote control?|User Interface reiterated that the remote control should have a robust and water resistant function. Marketing also mentioned a good tactile feel for the remote control function, which doesn't make hand sweat a lot. Therefore, Project Manager suggested a clip feature on the remote control so that people can clip it to their device.|"[""Project Manager: Here we go . Welcome everybody . Um , I'm Abigail Claflin .

Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: like that's another {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , clip . Ooh {vocalsound} . Um .
Project Manager: Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah I think so .
Project Manager: yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The something , what is the U_I_ ?
Industrial Designer: User .
Project Manager: Yeah , what does it stand for again ?
User Interface: That's me . Uh , User Interface design .
Project Manager: User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w
User Interface: So technical function .
Industrial Designer: The working design is the structure .
Project Manager: Yeah , yeah .
User Interface: What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Um , I guess you'd have to find out {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Um .
Marketing: It says on that email but it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It was in the email .
User Interface: It does but it {disfmarker} I just don't really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I wrote down what mine were .
Marketing: It said um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: It said {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright .
Marketing: Yeah
User Interface: And working design .
Marketing: like {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Be a medium between you and the telly I think ,
User Interface: Yeah , yeah . Alright .

Why did Marketing suggest giving up on speech recognition when presenting the functional requirements?|When Marketing mentioned that their target group should be both young people and people above forty who were not keen on new features, Marketing thought it would be too expensive to have the speech recognition and not reachable for twenty-five Euros. Also, Marketing suggested a DVD player, stereo, and VCR for television.|"[""Project Manager: that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like {disfmarker} look like .

Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Mm . Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,
Marketing: I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: because {disfmarker} Yeah .
Marketing: because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .
Project Manager: It's too {disfmarker} Okay .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Um then {disfmarker} I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's {vocalsound} not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise .
Project Manager: Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably .
Marketing: Yeah , only only for television uh {disfmarker} On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .
User Interface: Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .
Marketing: Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a {vocalsound} a new product . We have to be um {disfmarker} Yeah . One of a kind , I think .
Project Manager: So it has to look uh uh uh unique ,
User Interface: Unique .
Marketing: {vocalsound} The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .
Project Manager: but {disfmarker} Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , I reckon {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But old people are not looking for that .
User Interface: Uh I think mm {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Not really .
Industrial Designer: But {disfmarker} Hmm yeah , T_V_ one .
User Interface: but {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition .
User Interface: Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: So
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: we have to make some decisions . So
Marketing: Okay , no speech recognition .
Project Manager: you can see on the uh {disfmarker} So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah , I think so .
Project Manager: If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's good .
Project Manager: Okay , we just take that one .
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: And what else , we have {disfmarker}
User Interface: Also the one in the dark . So uh {disfmarker} It lights up when it's dark ?
Project Manager: Yeah , but it's {disfmarker} Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same .
User Interface: I didn't {disfmarker}
Project Manager: If you push something , it it all lights up .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Yeah . Yeah yeah ,
User Interface: Yeah , but um {disfmarker}
Marketing: it it mustn't work all the time .
User Interface: Yes , that's what I mean .
Marketing: It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .
Project Manager: Or you can switch it on or something .
Marketing: So if you {disfmarker}
User Interface: Or maybe when you {disfmarker}
Marketing: No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .
User Interface: yeah . It lights up all .
Project Manager: Yeah , that's right . You have to {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .

What did User Interface think of Marketing's suggestion on the ease of use when presenting the functional requirements?|When Marketing mentioned that they should make a new product that looked fancy, fashionable, and was easy to use for elderly users, User Interface suggested making sure that the remote control had better usability and could stand out by just being watched.

Summarize the presentation and discussion on technical function design.|Firstly, User Interface suggested the group should stand up with a unique design like different shapes than usual. User Interface also suggested a new option for favorite channels and a menu button that could integrate with volume, the previous and next buttons. The group agreed to make the remote a bit smaller and would like to look at mobile phones when designing it.|"[""Project Manager: that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like {disfmarker} look like .

Marketing: to k to keep it simple when you {disfmarker}
User Interface: But uh we also have to stand out ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Sorry I thought about it , yes .
User Interface: 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape ,
Project Manager: Yeah . Okay .
User Interface: so {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay , this was uh my presentation .
Project Manager: Thanks .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: I don't {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Paul , you can do the next one if you want .
Marketing: You can ask some questions or something .
User Interface: Okay . Yeah well {disfmarker} Uh .
Project Manager: It's on the on the uh net net uh thing ,
User Interface: There it is .
Project Manager: isn't it ?
User Interface: Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't {disfmarker} that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .
Project Manager: So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah , I have it on the next page .
Industrial Designer: Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things
Project Manager: So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker} Yeah . I I think so . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh j Is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .
Project Manager: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} I think it's usable .
User Interface: Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?
Marketing: Yeah , that's active .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Or just a green one ,
User Interface: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: because it's {disfmarker} If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .
User Interface: Yeah . Maybe uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , that's right .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , when you press it .
Project Manager: But if you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}

What did the group discuss about remote control style and design optimization?|Industrial Designer desired to integrate remote controls for different appliances into one. Marketing pointed out that such integration would lead to too many buttons, which was not user-friendly enough. Instead, Marketing suggested that a menu display should be incorporated. Project Manager and User Interface agreed and added that basic buttons could remain. User Interface and Industrial Designer refused the flip top, however, for it costs a lot. The team temporarily chose lightweight plastic to be the material.|"['User Interface: Hmm hmm hmm .', ""Project Manager: {vocalsound} Are we {disfmarker} we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ?"", 'User Interface: Yeah .', ""Project Manager: Okay , that's fine .

Project Manager: Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: So then {disfmarker}
Marketing: You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone
Project Manager: No , yeah .
Marketing: {disfmarker} user-friendly to everyone . Okay .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Big target group {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: yes , yes , I don't think we have to {disfmarker} I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point ,
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: Okay . What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got {disfmarker} we got um {disfmarker} we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Alright .
User Interface: that c
Project Manager: but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah uh .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
Industrial Designer: Use all the ones at the same time .
Marketing: Right .
User Interface: Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah ,
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions ,
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .
Project Manager: Yeah , the main {disfmarker} that's the main stuff anyway , I mean
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: {disfmarker} and you don't want to {disfmarker} I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .
User Interface: So simplification of symbols you could think of .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um . When they're {disfmarker} when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .
Marketing: Oh yeah . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: 'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: it's obvious what you're doing , um .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Menu , alright .
Marketing: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,

Project Manager: 'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: it's obvious what you're doing , um .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Menu , alright .
Marketing: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Uh uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .
Marketing: With menus , yeah , yeah .
User Interface: And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?
User Interface: {vocalsound} You mean to save it lesser number .
Project Manager: Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
User Interface: Right .
Project Manager: I don't think they tape things ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I don't think they use {disfmarker}
Marketing: Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,
Project Manager: Mm , yeah , the age gap .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .
Project Manager: Mm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: I don't know , I d
Industrial Designer: But I don't know how {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost {vocalsound} in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one
Project Manager: and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .
Marketing: Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Teletext has got that option as well .
Marketing: Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .
Project Manager: Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm , okay . S
Project Manager: I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Y
User Interface: It might
Marketing: Yeah ?
User Interface: it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Yes , no that's important .
User Interface: But it might have its cost implications .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , like smaller .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?
Project Manager: Mm .

Project Manager: Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: So then {disfmarker}
Marketing: You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone
Project Manager: No , yeah .
Marketing: {disfmarker} user-friendly to everyone . Okay .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Big target group {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: yes , yes , I don't think we have to {disfmarker} I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point ,
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: Okay . What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got {disfmarker} we got um {disfmarker} we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Alright .
User Interface: that c
Project Manager: but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah uh .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
Industrial Designer: Use all the ones at the same time .
Marketing: Right .
User Interface: Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah ,
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .
Marketing: With menus , yeah , yeah .
User Interface: And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?
User Interface: {vocalsound} You mean to save it lesser number .
Project Manager: Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
User Interface: Right .
Project Manager: I don't think they tape things ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I don't think they use {disfmarker}
Marketing: Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,
Project Manager: Mm , yeah , the age gap .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .
Project Manager: Mm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: I don't know , I d
Industrial Designer: But I don't know how {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost {vocalsound} in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one
Project Manager: and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .
Marketing: Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Teletext has got that option as well .
Marketing: Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .
Project Manager: Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .

Industrial Designer: Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Sure .
Industrial Designer: about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of {disfmarker} I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui
Marketing: Ah right .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Okay .
Industrial Designer: I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic
Marketing: Sure b y yeah .
Industrial Designer: and it'd look quite good but {disfmarker}
Marketing: But {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know {vocalsound} th that was my main point ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper ,
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: I presume it would .
Project Manager: I would {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter ,
Marketing: Right .
Project Manager: so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Okay , so let's break it up there . Okay ?

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: So then {disfmarker}
Marketing: You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone
Project Manager: No , yeah .
Marketing: {disfmarker} user-friendly to everyone . Okay .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Big target group {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: yes , yes , I don't think we have to {disfmarker} I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point ,
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: Okay . What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got {disfmarker} we got um {disfmarker} we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Alright .
User Interface: that c
Project Manager: but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah uh .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
Industrial Designer: Use all the ones at the same time .
Marketing: Right .
User Interface: Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah ,
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions ,
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .
Project Manager: Yeah , the main {disfmarker} that's the main stuff anyway , I mean
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: {disfmarker} and you don't want to {disfmarker} I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .
User Interface: So simplification of symbols you could think of .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um . When they're {disfmarker} when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .
Marketing: Oh yeah . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: 'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: it's obvious what you're doing , um .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Menu , alright .
Marketing: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Uh uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .
Marketing: Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Teletext has got that option as well .
Marketing: Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .
Project Manager: Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm , okay . S
Project Manager: I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Y
User Interface: It might
Marketing: Yeah ?
User Interface: it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Yes , no that's important .
User Interface: But it might have its cost implications .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , like smaller .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?
Project Manager: Mm .

Summarize the discussion about the user interface design.|The user interface designer introduced three concepts in the user interface - Google controller, fancy controller, and intelligent controller. The three meant that the product would be simple but powerful, attractive and recognizable, and loaded with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology. The first two were approved by the project manager, but the last one was seriously questioned. After a lot of discussions, the group finally decided to mix the Google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands.|"['Project Manager: {vocalsound} yeah .', 'User Interface: Yeah .', 'Marketing: {vocalsound}', ""User Interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . {vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,"", 'Marketing: {vocalsound}', 'Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .', 'User Interface: yeah .', 'Project Manager: Yeah , why not . {vocalsound}', 'User Interface: Yeah .

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: {vocalsound} yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . {vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface: yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah , why not . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: so .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user .
Project Manager: Okay . Something else ?
User Interface: Okay . No . There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?
User Interface: Yeah , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?
User Interface: Y
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .
Project Manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?
User Interface: Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,
User Interface: then present it later .
Marketing: okay .
Industrial Designer: exac
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You will had s some more information in {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , true .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: In fact , I don't know ,
Project Manager: So . Okay .
Industrial Designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay , never mind .
Industrial Designer: so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker} so . So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation
Industrial Designer: and how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It It is an an interesting concept to see {disfmarker} to have uh voice control .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .
User Interface: The smart controller . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But {disfmarker} and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: so .
Project Manager: but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .
Industrial Designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .
Project Manager: That's true .
Marketing: Yeah {disfmarker} d
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,
Marketing: I dunno .
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .
User Interface: Yeah . It's good .
Project Manager: And L_C_D_ buttons .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , L_C_D_ .
Project Manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to {disfmarker}
Marketing: What interface ?
Project Manager: Yeah , for the interface something {disfmarker} added value .
Industrial Designer: I think the supplement can be the voice {vocalsound} . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of {disfmarker}
Project Manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Mm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .

Why did the user interface designer propose the concept of intelligent controller?|The user interface designer believed a controller with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology would be convenient when you couldn't find it. More importantly, although the feature was not one hundred percent reliable, it was a feature to distinguish the new product from traditional ones. And there's not enough motivation for users to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller.|"[""Project Manager: {vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design ."", 'Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}', 'Project Manager: So ,', 'Marketing: Mm-hmm .', 'Project Manager: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary', 'Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .', ""Project Manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision .

Project Manager: So ,
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ?
Project Manager: What ?
Marketing: No ?
Project Manager: I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: So , we'll {disfmarker} S
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: technical accessoire ?
User Interface: No no no .
Project Manager: Interface ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: This .
User Interface: Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: A nice one .
User Interface: attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It's very big ,
Project Manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's right .
Project Manager: You're not you're not obliged to share it .
Marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .
Project Manager: Yeah , we can {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can {vocalsound} I can say channel three ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} it's {gap} {vocalsound}
Marketing: No .
User Interface: so it's c come to channel three ,
Marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .
User Interface: I don't have to {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .
User Interface: It's advantage .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to
Project Manager: Yeah , but one other question .
Industrial Designer: manual controllers , eh .
Project Manager: How how much will it cost ?
Industrial Designer: No , more expensive maybe .
User Interface: How much ?
Project Manager: Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .
User Interface: No no we we d we we just are use um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Some some efficient .
Marketing: Uh if you if if you use the basic {disfmarker}
User Interface: No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .
Project Manager: So you think it won't cost an {disfmarker} Not a lot for us ? Or ?
User Interface: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , but uh uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: it's uh {disfmarker} yeah . It's {disfmarker}
User Interface: that's quite inter quite attractive .
Industrial Designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so {disfmarker} although y y
User Interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah but i i {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing: I dunno .
User Interface: We should have confidence in technology . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , we should . {vocalsound} Uh .
Project Manager: Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: What ?
Project Manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?
Marketing: If if {disfmarker} I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .
User Interface: More features , yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Marketing: But if if if it like doubles uh
Industrial Designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable ,
Marketing: no one would would be interested .
Industrial Designer: so .
Project Manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Just want to have something {disfmarker} controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ?
User Interface: Yeah but if if you stick to um {disfmarker} stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .

Why did the project manager disapprove of the concept of intelligent controller?|The project manager put forward that the speech recognition wouldn't work when several persons wanted to change the channel at the same time, and the cost would surely rise if adding the two technologies. In response to that, the user interface designer said they would just cooperate with some research institute and the vocabulary was limited, so it wouldn't cost much. Then the project manager posed the language problem. The user interface designer answered they would have some language adaptations so the product could be used by people from all countries. Finally, there were still problems with the microphone and camera that were necessary for the two technologies.|"[""Project Manager: {vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design ."", 'Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}', 'Project Manager: So ,', 'Marketing: Mm-hmm .', 'Project Manager: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary', 'Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .', ""Project Manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision .

User Interface: Y
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .
Project Manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?

Summarize the discussion about product industrial design.|The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects —material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood instead of plastic to make the controller more fashionable and having buttons with LCD so that people could see the controller in dark. In terms of the alimentation, it would be good to have both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation. Considering that the product was supposed to be easy to use, the industrial designer thought some low level chip would be enough, which was agreed by the group.|"['Industrial Designer: Well y y you have also the language problem ,', ""User Interface: No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}"", 'Industrial Designer: you know when you {disfmarker}', 'Project Manager: Mm-mm .', ""Industrial Designer: 'Cause it it have to be universal ,"", 'Project Manager: Yeah .

Industrial Designer: Well y y you have also the language problem ,
User Interface: No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: you know when you {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-mm .
Industrial Designer: 'Cause it it have to be universal ,
Project Manager: Yeah . I agree with uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: so .
User Interface: The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're {disfmarker} we want to sell it in France .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: so .
User Interface: Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our {disfmarker} the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation
Marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah but you know . The product {disfmarker} The pro
User Interface: mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm , okay .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Project Manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?
User Interface: it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . But {disfmarker}
User Interface: Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed .
Project Manager: Yeah , but how will you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,
User Interface: then present it later .
Marketing: okay .
Industrial Designer: exac
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You will had s some more information in {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , true .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: In fact , I don't know ,
Project Manager: So . Okay .
Industrial Designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay , never mind .
Industrial Designer: so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker} so . So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation
Project Manager: Turning the T_V_ o on o or off .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , turning {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,
Project Manager: So ,
Industrial Designer: so .
Project Manager: adding some vocal commands .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Simple ones ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , simple ones for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} we'll {disfmarker} you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yep . Yeah .
Project Manager: Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} expensive buttons {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah , to make some new {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .
Marketing: Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Okay , fruits .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: If possible .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really {disfmarker} it will be seen in the remote control .
Industrial Designer: Need it to be , okay .
Project Manager: So you will have {disfmarker} Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .

Why did the group decide to use both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation when discussing the industrial design?|With the solar energy alimentation, people in remote areas could recharge the controller more conveniently. Plus, it might attract some ecologists to purchase.

User Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .
Project Manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm .
Project Manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers
Industrial Designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: no ?
Industrial Designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,
Project Manager: So .
Industrial Designer: but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: so hmm .
Project Manager: And what tha what about the uh materials ?
Industrial Designer: And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common
Project Manager: Impersonal , mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Special for {disfmarker}
Marketing: 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris
Industrial Designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah .
Marketing: we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay .
Marketing: okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .
Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah , yeah .
Marketing: I dunno .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?
Marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like um
Industrial Designer: Pla S
Marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh
Industrial Designer: Very stuff {disfmarker} Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: device , so um
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Solar .
Marketing: Yeah , so when I think it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: maybe will attract
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm
Industrial Designer: It will be a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: pro-ecology consumers .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .

Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You will had s some more information in {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , true .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: In fact , I don't know ,
Project Manager: So . Okay .
Industrial Designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay , never mind .
Industrial Designer: so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker} so . So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation
Industrial Designer: or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .
Project Manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm .
Project Manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers
Industrial Designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: no ?
Industrial Designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,
Project Manager: So .
Industrial Designer: but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: so hmm .
Project Manager: And what tha what about the uh materials ?
Industrial Designer: And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common
Project Manager: Impersonal , mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Special for {disfmarker}
Marketing: 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris
Industrial Designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah .
Marketing: we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay .
Marketing: okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .
Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah , yeah .
Marketing: I dunno .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?
Marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like um
Industrial Designer: Pla S
Marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh
Industrial Designer: Very stuff {disfmarker} Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: device , so um
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Solar .
Marketing: Yeah , so when I think it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: maybe will attract
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm
Industrial Designer: It will be a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: pro-ecology consumers .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .

Summarize the discussion about user requirements.|The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel rather than a functional one. Apart from that, they still wanted the product to be technologically innovative. At the same time, being user-friendly was also important. Then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice.|"[""Project Manager: {vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design ."", 'Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}', 'Project Manager: So ,', 'Marketing: Mm-hmm .', 'Project Manager: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary', 'Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .', ""Project Manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision .

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So ,
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ?
Project Manager: What ?
Marketing: No ?
Project Manager: I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: So , we'll {disfmarker} S
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: technical accessoire ?
User Interface: No no no .
Project Manager: Interface ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: This .
User Interface: Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: A nice one .
User Interface: attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It's very big ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . {vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface: yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah , why not . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: so .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user .
Project Manager: Okay . Something else ?
User Interface: Okay . No . There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?
User Interface: Yeah , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?
User Interface: Y
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .
Project Manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?
User Interface: Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So you got email ?
Project Manager: I dunno . {vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Participant four ? Functional requirements ?
Marketing: Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: This one ?
Marketing: Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,
Industrial Designer: Ah yes .
Marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .

What did the marketing recommend to do when discussing the problem of fashion?|That year everything from clothes to shoes and furniture was inspired by fruits and vegetables so the marketing suggested taking that into account. The marketing also mentioned that people wanted a spongy touch which meant the product might be partly wooden and partly rubber-made.|"['Project Manager: Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .', 'Marketing: Mm-hmm .', 'Industrial Designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood', 'User Interface: Mm-hmm .', 'Marketing: Yeah .', 'Project Manager: Mm-hmm .

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .
Industrial Designer: and it can be interesting .
Project Manager: Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .
Industrial Designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .
Project Manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and {disfmarker} so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: And you think that we will be {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: so .
Project Manager: So wood .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: And what about the buttons ?
Industrial Designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know {vocalsound} lighted buttons because , you know , it's {disfmarker} I don't know {vocalsound} um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion
Project Manager: No it's fashion , yeah .
Industrial Designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .
Marketing: What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think a touch screen {vocalsound} will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: But {disfmarker} And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So you got email ?
Project Manager: I dunno . {vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Participant four ? Functional requirements ?
Marketing: Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: This one ?
Marketing: Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,
Industrial Designer: Ah yes .
Marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .
Marketing: 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris
Industrial Designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah .
Marketing: we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay .
Marketing: okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .
Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah , yeah .
Marketing: I dunno .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?
Marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like um
Industrial Designer: Pla S
Marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh
Industrial Designer: Very stuff {disfmarker} Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: device , so um
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Solar .
Marketing: Yeah , so when I think it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: maybe will attract
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm
Industrial Designer: It will be a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: pro-ecology consumers .

What was the decision of the discussion about fulfilling user requirements?|To meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy, the group decided to use wood and rubber to make the controller.

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So ,
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ?
Project Manager: What ?
Marketing: No ?
Project Manager: I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: So , we'll {disfmarker} S
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: technical accessoire ?
User Interface: No no no .
Project Manager: Interface ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: This .
User Interface: Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: A nice one .
User Interface: attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It's very big ,
Project Manager: Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Two ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , participant two um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Working ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , working design ,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: so .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I can {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Can you go to the {vocalsound} next one ? I uh {disfmarker} it's not this one .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: It's uh oth the oth {vocalsound} so I {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's the working design . Sorry . {vocalsound} Component design .
Project Manager: It's okay {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So this yeah {disfmarker} so this is the described use {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: What ? Are you inst
Project Manager: Uh I think there's something wrong with your {disfmarker}
User Interface: It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .
Project Manager: Maybe you you record it somewhere else .
Industrial Designer: I don't think so .
User Interface: Participant one . Participant one .
Project Manager: Interface concept . No .
Marketing: Hmm .
Project Manager: Mm mm .
Industrial Designer: Oh . Maybe I record recorded directly on the {disfmarker} Computer .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Uh . {vocalsound} Nope . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Dunno .
Industrial Designer: Okay , okay . Yes .
Project Manager: It seems that we have a problem with the {disfmarker}
Marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I can say it to you without .
Project Manager: Yeah , so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to
Project Manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides ,
Marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So you got email ?
Project Manager: I dunno . {vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Participant four ? Functional requirements ?
Marketing: Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: This one ?
Marketing: Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,
Industrial Designer: Ah yes .
Marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .

What did the group discuss about battery issues and flip top design?|On battery issue, Industrial Designer expressed a desire to minimize the size of the battery. Meanwhile, cost, power consumption, wireless range and data transmission were supposed to be considered. User Interface's presentation followed. The remote control design would be simplified and user-friendly. To make the style more trendy, User Interface decided on a flip-top model.|"['User Interface: Yep .', 'Industrial Designer: Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .', 'Project Manager: {vocalsound}', ""Industrial Designer: 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really .

Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control ."", 'Marketing: Mm-hmm .

What did Industrial Designer think of triple A batteries when discussing battery issues and flip top design?|Industrial Designer admitted that current remote controls were mostly powered by triple A batteries. However, Industrial Designer also pointed out that they were bulky, although they had been the smallest fit-in batteries at present. Industrial Designer expressed a desire to find a smaller alternative for triple A batteries.|"['User Interface: Yep .', 'Industrial Designer: Yep there we go .

Meeting Transcript:
User Interface: Yep .
Industrial Designer: Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .
Marketing: Mm-hmm . Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah sure .
Marketing: is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .
Marketing: Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah the the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: They are .
Industrial Designer: well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption
Marketing: Oh I see .
Industrial Designer: and how much you need to send the data across .
Marketing: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .
Project Manager: Um , what other functions ? We need {disfmarker} I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about {disfmarker} c 'cause you've got the dilemma between {disfmarker} oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
Industrial Designer: Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well they la they they last quite a long time ,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: and if you had uh {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .
Industrial Designer: Yeah and if {disfmarker} yeah if you if you had if you had one of those {disfmarker} uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah it could be on that {disfmarker} yeah , okay .
Industrial Designer: Yeah on that as well so .
User Interface: So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
Project Manager: S
Industrial Designer: Yeah
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: some sort of docking station or {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Rechargeable with a docking station .
Industrial Designer: yeah .
Project Manager: So the rechargeable which would be your field .
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine ,
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .
User Interface: Right .
Project Manager: Yes ,
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: which it is cheaper in the long run as well .

Summarize the discussion about market research and adjustments due to new project requirements.|The market research presented by Marketing implicated that the remote control design was expected to be more stylish and less complicated. Project Manager added that an ideal model would be for TV only and have a corporate logo incorporated. To meet the requirements above, Industrial Designer recommended a touch screen panel. Marketing suggested that the remote control size could be adjusted due to physical differences among international users. The team gave up speech recognition, for it would cost a lot. An alarm would be incorporated for detection in case the remote control was lost in the house.|"['Marketing: Get it right over , okay , thank you .', 'Project Manager: Ah .

Why did Industrial Designer think of incorporating an alarm when discussing market research and adjustments due to new project requirements?|The market research implicated that users' biggest frustration was their failure in finding the remote control once it was lost in the house. To solve the problem, Industrial Designer suggested that a button could be added on the TV; when the user pressed the button, the remote control would beep to let the user know its location.

Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well .
Marketing: Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno ,
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may {disfmarker} and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs {gap} ?
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Sure .
Industrial Designer: Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs
User Interface: Alright .
Industrial Designer: I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .
User Interface: Right .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
Industrial Designer: Just {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: yeah , yeah .
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: What about {disfmarker} you were talking about the buttons ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers
Industrial Designer: 'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to {disfmarker} you don't actually have to press them you just {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Um , think that might appeal {disfmarker} I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people ,
Marketing: Mm . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: trendy kind of a thing .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
Project Manager: Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can {gap} oh yeah that's obvious what that's for
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm , mm .
Industrial Designer: Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um {vocalsound} if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big
Project Manager: Were too big .
Industrial Designer: because um {vocalsound} they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh {disfmarker} so if you {disfmarker} I don't know what {disfmarker} 'cause you {disfmarker} obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .
User Interface: Yeah , uh maybe to {disfmarker} as uh {disfmarker} it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control
Marketing: Uh-huh . Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ?
Project Manager: Um it could be it c It {disfmarker} yes ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature ,
Marketing: Right .
Project Manager: you know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .

What's the conclusion of the remote control style when discussing market research and adjustments due to new project requirements?|Overall, the model style was expected to be trendy and appealing. Marketing and Project Manager agreed on User Interface's design of a flip-screen. Marketing also hoped that the remote control would be slightly curved. User Interface added that the remote control would curl up to users' hands so that their thumbs did not have to press. The corporate logo would be put in the corner. The model would be made of lightweight plastic with a smooth bottom and a nice scallop shell exterior.|"[""User Interface: but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,"", 'Marketing: Get it right over , okay , thank you .', 'Project Manager: Ah . Look at that .', ""Marketing: Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . {vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . {vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .

What were the statements discussed by the members?|Several members expressed their gratitude towards various groups such as first responders, working populations and different companies that have come together to help with the COVID crisis. Students whose education had undergone a radical change were highlighted and their fortitude appreciated. There was also a call to rally for disenfranchised groups such as rural residents, black lives movement and non-binary persons.|"[""Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Mr. Chair, it's an honour and a privilege to present a petition on behalf of the constituents of NanaimoLadysmith. People are concerned about gas fracking and the use of methane and the destruction that methane causes to our atmosphere and with climate change. They're calling on the government to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on the Wet'suwet'en territory, and by ordering the RCMP to dismantle their exclusion zone and to stand down. They also call on the government to schedule nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentswhich is something that we're happy to see has been happening and I commend the government for that effortand to prioritize the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples."", 'The Chair: Next is Mr. Lamoureux.', ""Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.): Mr. Chair, like Canada, Guyana is part of the Commonwealth, and many constituents of Winnipeg North have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in March, when it was being called into question. There have been some very positive indications in recent days, but the petitioners are asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to be aware of what's taking place in Guyana, and as much as possible, to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we're being diligent in supporting what the people of Guyana want to see."", 'The Chair: Mr.Blanchet, you have 43seconds left.', ""Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: That will be enough. I would be remiss if I allowed the Prime Minister to mislead people quite unintentionallyI say this in accordance with the Standing Orders. When we introduce a bill, we discuss it at second reading, we vote, we continue to discuss it and we send it to committee. All that can be done very quickly. However, we must be able to amend and improve this bill. That is how the normal Parliament works. The government doesn't like being in a minority situation. It behaves as if it were a majority government, but it is not. Can we follow the real procedures of Parliament, do a proper job, and then have a vote that is likely to suit the majority of members, not just the Prime Minister?"", 'Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, my hon. colleague seems to completely forget that we are going through a pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis requires different actions on our part. That is why we provided the text of the bill to the opposition parties four days ago. We have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill, if they had amendments to propose. That is how we are taking action to help Canadians quickly during this crisis, and that is what we will continue to do.', 'The Chair: Mr.Singh, you have the floor.', 'Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP): Mr.Chair, will the Prime Minister make a clear and direct commitment today to extend the CERB for families who need it?', 'Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help Canadians living with disabilities, will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit. We hope to be able to debate it.', 'Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB for families in need, yes or no?', ""Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, a family that needs to buy groceries can't take those pretty words and buy groceries with them. We're asking the Prime Minister to extend the CERB for families in need. Will the Prime Minister do that, yes or no?"", 'Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to be there for Canadians in the right way. We are engaged with stakeholders, with opposition parties and with Canadians to ensure that we continue to support them the way they need to be supported.', ""Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, I can tell you what the right way is. Don from Burnaby sent me a note saying he's an arts worker and there is no forecast for his job to be reopened. He is now dependent on the CERB. He wants to go back to work, but there's no work. He sent an email saying he's faced with a grim realityhis wordsand he's frightened that if the CERB runs out, and it is planned to run out at the end of this month, then he will have no way to afford to make ends meet.

Meeting Transcript:
Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Mr. Chair, it's an honour and a privilege to present a petition on behalf of the constituents of NanaimoLadysmith. People are concerned about gas fracking and the use of methane and the destruction that methane causes to our atmosphere and with climate change. They're calling on the government to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on the Wet'suwet'en territory, and by ordering the RCMP to dismantle their exclusion zone and to stand down. They also call on the government to schedule nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentswhich is something that we're happy to see has been happening and I commend the government for that effortand to prioritize the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
The Chair: Next is Mr. Lamoureux.
Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.): Mr. Chair, like Canada, Guyana is part of the Commonwealth, and many constituents of Winnipeg North have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in March, when it was being called into question. There have been some very positive indications in recent days, but the petitioners are asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to be aware of what's taking place in Guyana, and as much as possible, to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we're being diligent in supporting what the people of Guyana want to see.
The Chair: Mr.Blanchet, you have 43seconds left.
Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: That will be enough. I would be remiss if I allowed the Prime Minister to mislead people quite unintentionallyI say this in accordance with the Standing Orders. When we introduce a bill, we discuss it at second reading, we vote, we continue to discuss it and we send it to committee. All that can be done very quickly. However, we must be able to amend and improve this bill. That is how the normal Parliament works. The government doesn't like being in a minority situation. It behaves as if it were a majority government, but it is not. Can we follow the real procedures of Parliament, do a proper job, and then have a vote that is likely to suit the majority of members, not just the Prime Minister?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, my hon. colleague seems to completely forget that we are going through a pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis requires different actions on our part. That is why we provided the text of the bill to the opposition parties four days ago. We have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill, if they had amendments to propose. That is how we are taking action to help Canadians quickly during this crisis, and that is what we will continue to do.
The Chair: Mr.Singh, you have the floor.
Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP): Mr.Chair, will the Prime Minister make a clear and direct commitment today to extend the CERB for families who need it?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help Canadians living with disabilities, will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit. We hope to be able to debate it.
Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB for families in need, yes or no?
Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, a family that needs to buy groceries can't take those pretty words and buy groceries with them. We're asking the Prime Minister to extend the CERB for families in need. Will the Prime Minister do that, yes or no?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to be there for Canadians in the right way. We are engaged with stakeholders, with opposition parties and with Canadians to ensure that we continue to support them the way they need to be supported.
Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, I can tell you what the right way is. Don from Burnaby sent me a note saying he's an arts worker and there is no forecast for his job to be reopened. He is now dependent on the CERB. He wants to go back to work, but there's no work. He sent an email saying he's faced with a grim realityhis wordsand he's frightened that if the CERB runs out, and it is planned to run out at the end of this month, then he will have no way to afford to make ends meet. Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB so Don does not have to live in fear?

What was the Prime minister and Government accused of?|The liberal of Government was accused of not allowing for adequate scrutiny of their spending. The Prime Minister was accused of locking down Parliament to avoid accountability, refusing to hold a first ministers meeting and refusing to negotiate to pass a bill.|"[""Hon. Andrew Scheer: The Prime Minister is again engaged in revisionist history. He well knows that it was the Auditor General's office that volunteered to make administrative efficiencies, which did not affect its ability to do the job. In fact, as the interim auditor general, John Wiersema, said, We would not have proposed if we didnt think it was the right thing to do and that wed be able to carry out our role for Parliament. Only the government's refusal to grant that extra funding is hampering the Auditor General's ability to give Canadians the answers they deserve, and we wonder why. This is the government that cannot explain where 20,000 infrastructure projects went and where five billion dollars' worth of supposed infrastructure investments have gone. They can't identify that. Then there is, of course, the $35-billion Infrastructure Bank, which has completed precisely zero projects. Are these the reasons the Prime Minister is so intent on withholding funds from the Auditor General?"", ""Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, talking of revisionist history, Stephen Harper's Conservatives cut $6.5 million from the Auditor General's budget and fired 60 staff. On the contrary, we worked with the Auditor General's office and increased its funding and added the equivalent of 38 new full-time staff. We will continue to demonstrate openness and transparency.

Hon. Steven Guilbeault (Minister of Canadian Heritage): First, Mr. Chair, I would like to offer my congratulations to the new Auditor General for her appointment. On behalf of the government, I would also like to offer her our full support and collaboration
The Chair: We'll go to Mr. Kelly.
Mr. Pat Kelly: I share the minister's wish to congratulate the new Auditor General on her position. I will now ask him again when he will give her the funds she needs to do her job.
Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, her role is essential to our democracy. We are eager to work with her. She's more than welcome to share her concerns directly with the government. I can assure her that my
The Chair: We'll go to Mr. Kelly.
Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, I didn't ask him if he would like to work with the Auditor General. I asked him if he will give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job.
Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, our government has added 38 permanent staff positions to her office, while the Conservative government, under their leadership, cut the funding for more than 60
The Chair: We'll move on to Mr. Kelly.
Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, through you, I caution the minister to not mislead this House. If he will look at the committee transcripts of the time, he will know that it was the Auditor General's decision to reduce their own budget. The Conservatives did not cut positions. That is a matter of fact. The point is that the Auditor General now does not have the money to do her job. She has cut performance audits and she has stopped work on performance audits. When will this government give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job?
Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, this government has drastically expanded its spending and is avoiding accountability in every way it can. The finance committee yesterday, with the support of Liberal backbench MPs who are on that committee, unanimously passed a motion to fund the Auditor General in full so that her office can do her job. If this minister will not listen to me, will he at least listen to his own backbenchers?
Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, our government is fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the Auditor General, an independent officer of Parliament. If the Auditor General identifies the need for additional resources, we will work with the Office of the Auditor General to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue fulfilling their mandate efficiently and effectively.
Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, the Auditor General has consistently, since 2018, told this government that the office doesn't have enough funds. It's not a mystery. The Auditor General has told the public accounts committee that it cannot do its job. It's the first time in history that the Auditor General has had to tell public accounts that they don't have the resources to do their job. It's not a matter of if the Auditor General needs more funds. The Auditor General couldn't be more clear. When will this government actually do the right thing and fully fund the Office of the Auditor General?
Hon. Steven Guilbeault: Mr. Chair, maybe I'm not making myself clear in English. I will switch to my native tongue, French, in case it becomes clearer. If the Auditor General identifies a need for additional resources, we will work with her to ensure that her office can continue to deliver its mandate efficiently and effectively. In addition, our government worked with the Auditor General to increase funding in 2018-09. With this increase, the office was able to add the equivalent of 38new full-time staff to its team. That's 38more employees
The Chair: The floor goes to Mr.Kelly.

What did the group discuss the functional design on the remote control?|Project Manager stated the meeting topic on function design. Firstly, Marketing concluded a study on user needs, including buttons for channel selection according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button, and suggested targeting on the nineteen to thirty-five years old age group to design functions. Next, User Interface presented on the technical effect on what functions users need and how to make the best functions for users. Then, Industrial Designer presented the working design, including input a channel or volume setting and output the location function to the television.|"['Marketing: Okay .', ""Project Manager: 'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time .

Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation ."", 'User Interface: Do you know about like {disfmarker}', 'Industrial Designer: Mm ?', 'User Interface: I dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound}', 'Industrial Designer: Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here .', 'User Interface: Okay .

Um ,"", 'Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}', ""Project Manager: also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television .

Um if we have something {disfmarker} I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay .

Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .
User Interface: Do you know about like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm ?
User Interface: I dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound}

Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something {disfmarker} I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . {vocalsound} Do {disfmarker} Let's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker}
User Interface: Like in terms of
Marketing: How it looks or {disfmarker}
User Interface: how it looks , or like what it does ?
Project Manager: wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .
User Interface: Yeah . Okay . So {disfmarker} Is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?

What did the group discuss the finder button and call button?|At the first beginning of the discussion, Industrial Designer mentioned that it would be easy to implement something like a buzzer to trace the remote location. Project Manager suggested a two-part package - on one hand, users could click the button on the TV to send out the signal; on the other hand, the remote base could beep probably so that users could know where the remote control has gone.|"[""Marketing: Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that .

What did group members think of the speech recognition design suggested by Marketing?|Marketing suggested the speech recognition design is for user groups aged from nineteen to thirty-five. Industrial Designer supplemented the feature design that if the TV is on and somebody says like one, then the TV would switch itself to channel one. However, Project Manager illustrated that considering the budget, to have the speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be expensive. And this ended up was commonly agreed by other group mates.|"[""Marketing: Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance .

User Interface: 'Kay . What's function ?
Project Manager: It's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th
User Interface: Oh function , I see it .
User Interface: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It's easy to implement .
User Interface: Okay . So the {disfmarker}
Marketing: {gap} the the buzzer you mean ,
User Interface: yeah , yeah , yeah .
Industrial Designer: Locator .
Marketing: yeah , for sure , yeah .
User Interface: So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,
Project Manager: Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .
User Interface: what was it ?
Marketing: Well that's for speech recognition .
Project Manager: Oh , uh .
Industrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Oh .
Marketing: And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen .
Industrial Designer: I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one ,
Marketing: Yeah yeah yeah .
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: I mean {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I'm not sure how you would implement it .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: I just put the values {vocalsound} in .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: But um the screen is the same as what , {gap}
Industrial Designer: It's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , I'm happy with that .
Project Manager: Yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Right so um {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface: Hu yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Completely .
Industrial Designer: Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place {gap} since the T_V_ already has power .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .
User Interface: Alright .
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager: So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: right . Yeah , yeah .
Marketing: So do you plug it in the T_ {disfmarker} you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .
Marketing: Okay . Okay .
User Interface: So it's now like a two-part thing .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , so it would be a two part package .
User Interface: Okay . Alright .
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: So we get to design that too .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Make it fashionable . Um , okay .
Project Manager: So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .
Industrial Designer: Yeah I think so .
Marketing: Yeah . Just there .
Project Manager: Huh . Okay .

Summarize the discussion about the VCR / VHR / DVD capability button.|Project Manager mentioned that the group needed to decide on the VCR capabilities and answered Industrial Designer's question on whether VCRs were the same across the world. So Industrial Designer suggested a whole different set of buttons for individual VCRs. Project Manager suggested DVD type if considering the target group as young professionals and teenagers.|"[""Marketing: Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance .

Marketing: Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um .
Project Manager: 'Kay .
Marketing: Shall I {disfmarker} what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?
Project Manager: Yeah . Just move right on .
User Interface: Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh function F_ eight .
Marketing: Function F_ eight .
User Interface: 'Kay . What's function ?
Project Manager: It's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th
User Interface: Oh function , I see it .
Industrial Designer: Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up .

Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .
Industrial Designer: Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: They're not {disfmarker} no .
Marketing: They're not , no .
Industrial Designer: Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s .
User Interface: S
Project Manager: Yeah , that's right , yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} It not V_H_S_ here ?
Project Manager: But D_V_D_ probably is .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , other than that region and coding thing .
User Interface: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days .
Marketing: But V_C_R_s {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , for sure .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can {disfmarker} I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much ,
Project Manager: S
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Huh .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: s and it's usually that red
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: You know , I've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh okay , yeah .
User Interface: It seems like that would be hard though .

Grad E: Hmm . Hmm . OK . And so I 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe so who is the user ? Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . We should be be clear . But when it comes to sort of writing down when you {disfmarker} when you do these things is it here ? You sort of have to a write the values this can take .
Professor B: Right .
Grad E: And here I was really uh in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because um {disfmarker} this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones um for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished .
Grad A: Hmm .
Professor B: No uh
Grad E: How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ? But OK . Thus is understandable ?
Grad A: Think so .
Grad C: Yes .
Grad E: So here for example .
Professor B: You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ?
Grad A: Uh , no , but I think I 'm following it . So far .
Grad E: So here is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions .
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad D: Hmm .
Grad E: There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things .
Grad D: Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? OK , h well I mean how is it different from user finance ?
Grad E: Um the finance is sort of here thought of as {disfmarker} as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he {disfmarker} is he cheap , average , or spendy ?
Grad D: Alright .
Grad E: And um I didn't come uh maybe a user I don't know , I didn't want to write greediness , but
Grad A: Yeah . Hmm .
Professor B: Or cheapness .
Grad E: Welcome .
Grad A: User thrift .
Grad E: Welcome .
Professor B: Thrift , that 's good .
Grad D: Yeah .
Professor B: Great .
Grad A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Professor B: s and so I {disfmarker} I don't yet know how to do this , I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: So that {disfmarker} that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse , and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for
Grad E: We {disfmarker} we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint .
Professor B: Of {disfmarker} of course .
Grad E: Identified that
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad E: and so again re that 's completely correct , we have the user model , the situation model here , we don't have the discourse model here yet . Much the same way as we didn't {disfmarker} we don't have the ontology here .
Professor B: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth .
Grad E: Really .
Professor B: So in some sense it 's {disfmarker} it 's there .
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet .
Grad E: Yeah . Um This be specific for second year ? Um And {disfmarker} and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint .
Professor B: But if we do it 'll have the three values .
Grad E: Hmm ?
Professor B: It 'll have the EVA values if {disfmarker} if we have it .
Grad E: Yeah . Yeah . OK just for starters and here discourse um
Professor B: For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . That 's what we talked about .
Grad E: um well , I think um we 're looking at the {disfmarker} the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Grad E: So this should sort of push it in one direction
Professor B: Right .
Professor B: And then also the discourse endpoint , I {disfmarker} I guess endpoint sub - D is {disfmarker} if you wanna make it consistent .
Grad C: Wh - ah .
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Grad A: Um actually is this the {disfmarker} the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because isn't the , I mean
Professor B: I think so . S
Grad A: uh , hmm OK . But that still allows for the possibility of the {disfmarker} of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from {disfmarker}
Professor B: Maybe not , a Right .
Grad A: That {disfmarker} all that {disfmarker} that kind of decision making happens at the Go - there node .
Professor B: Uh y you {disfmarker} yeah you {disfmarker} i you {disfmarker} if you needed to do that .
Grad A: Uh . If you needed it to do that .
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad A: But uh OK I was just thinking I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible {disfmarker} possible asking of the user
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad A: you know hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something
Professor B: Ah . Good point , I don't {disfmarker} I don't know how we 're going to {disfmarker} t uh
Grad A: or Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model but , you know , directly out of interaction .
Professor B: Right . Uh I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough .
Grad E: Yeah .
Professor B: Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things
Grad A: OK .
Professor B: you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ?

What did the group members think of the value of user budget when discussing value for user and situation models?|The reason why they mentioned user budget was that they wanted to take this example to further discuss the value for user model. Also, user budget was an important factor for the outcomes of decisions. Then, they tried to decide which set of words could represent the budget better. Finally, they found that the words that could describe financial policy of users, such as user thrift, was appropriate.|"[""Grad E: Hmm . Hmm . OK .

Meeting Transcript:
Grad E: Hmm . Hmm . OK . And so I 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe so who is the user ? Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . We should be be clear . But when it comes to sort of writing down when you {disfmarker} when you do these things is it here ? You sort of have to a write the values this can take .
Professor B: Right .
Grad E: And here I was really uh in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because um {disfmarker} this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones um for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished .
Grad A: Hmm .
Professor B: No uh
Grad E: How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ? But OK . Thus is understandable ?
Grad A: Think so .
Grad C: Yes .
Grad E: So here for example .
Professor B: You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ?
Grad A: Uh , no , but I think I 'm following it . So far .
Grad E: So here is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions .
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad D: Hmm .
Grad E: There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things .
Grad D: Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? OK , h well I mean how is it different from user finance ?
Grad E: Um the finance is sort of here thought of as {disfmarker} as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he {disfmarker} is he cheap , average , or spendy ?
Grad D: Alright .
Grad E: And um I didn't come uh maybe a user I don't know , I didn't want to write greediness , but
Grad A: Yeah . Hmm .
Professor B: Or cheapness .
Grad E: Welcome .
Grad A: User thrift .
Grad E: Welcome .
Professor B: Thrift , that 's good .
Grad D: Yeah .
Professor B: Great .
Grad E: Uh - huh . OK .
Professor B: Good . Right .
Grad E: So now we 're looking for user related things that um
Professor B: Yeah . And uh maybe th maybe it 's just one who is the user , I don't know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe there 's more .
Grad A: Huh .
Grad E: Well if he 's usi if he 's in a car right now what was that people with Harry drove the car into the cafe
Professor B: Never mind . Uh anyway , this is crude . Now but the {disfmarker} now so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} but then the question is uh so {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology , but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse .
Grad E: Well let 's {disfmarker} should we finish this ,
Professor B: Sure ,
Grad E: I mean but surely the user interests
Professor B: OK .
Grad C: The user thrift , the user budget .
Grad E: yeah , yeah
Professor B: Well , maybe , I again , I d well , OK , put em in but what we 're gonna wanna do is actually uh
Grad C: Well is {disfmarker}
Grad E: Here this was one of my problems we have the user interest is a {disfmarker} is a vector of five hundred values , so um That 's from the user model ,
Grad D: Oh you mean level of interest ?
Grad E: mm - hmm , no not levels of interest but things you can be interested in .
Grad A: Well {disfmarker}
Professor B: somebody else has built this user model .
Grad D: Oh I see ,
Grad E: Gothic churches versus Baroque townhouses versus
Grad D: right . So why is it oh it , so it 's like a vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ?
Grad E: Yea - n is that
Grad D: Like for each thing are we {disfmarker} are you interested in it or not ?
Grad E: yeah uh I {disfmarker} I think
Grad D: I see .
Professor B: And then also the discourse endpoint , I {disfmarker} I guess endpoint sub - D is {disfmarker} if you wanna make it consistent .
Grad C: Wh - ah .
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Grad A: Um actually is this the {disfmarker} the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because isn't the , I mean
Professor B: I think so . S
Grad A: uh , hmm OK . But that still allows for the possibility of the {disfmarker} of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from {disfmarker}
Professor B: Maybe not , a Right .
Grad A: That {disfmarker} all that {disfmarker} that kind of decision making happens at the Go - there node .
Professor B: Uh y you {disfmarker} yeah you {disfmarker} i you {disfmarker} if you needed to do that .
Grad A: Uh . If you needed it to do that .
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad A: But uh OK I was just thinking I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible {disfmarker} possible asking of the user
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad A: you know hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something
Professor B: Ah . Good point , I don't {disfmarker} I don't know how we 're going to {disfmarker} t uh
Grad A: or Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model but , you know , directly out of interaction .
Professor B: Right . Uh I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough .
Grad E: Yeah .
Professor B: Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things
Grad A: OK .
Professor B: you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ?
Grad A: Yeah .

Summarize the discussion about Go-there decision.|Grad E proposed the idea that Go-there decision was also worth thinking about. Professor B suggested that the decision could stick to the discourse properties as a placeholder. With regard to the lack of ontologies, Professor B thought that it could use the same properties like exhibiting and selling. Grad E doubted the choice of binary EVA values, but Professor B insisted that it was still necessary to make this choice. Then the group members discussed the layout of belief-nets, for example, the connection between Go-there nodes and other ones such as endpoints. And Professor B reminded me that the belief-nets should not have loops.|"['Grad E: Given {disfmarker} given uh uh not transverse the castle , the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just', ""Professor B: Right , true .

Grad E: Given {disfmarker} given uh uh not transverse the castle , the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just
Professor B: Right , true . Does have to be there . And I 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that
Grad E: And Hmm ? So Go - there in the first place or not is definitely uh one of the basic ones . We can start with that . Interesting effect . Um Is this basically true or false or maybe we 'll get
Professor B: Well {disfmarker}
Grad D: Which one ?
Grad E: what ?
Grad A: "" Go there "" .
Grad E: m right .
Professor B: so there is this question about
Grad E: Here we we actually get just probabilities ,
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad E: right for each down here .
Professor B: When we 're {disfmarker} yeah when we 're done . So {disfmarker} so
Grad E: Hmm .
Professor B: the {disfmarker} the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when so it 's , you know uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all ,
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: right ? And so that a decision would be do we want that so you could {disfmarker} two different things you could do , you could have all those values for Go - there or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when .
Grad E: When . How .
Professor B: Yeah and so forth .
Grad E: Why ,
Professor B: So I 'll let
Grad E: yeah .
Professor B: we 'll see .
Grad E: Hmm ?
Grad A: I mean it seems that you could um uh it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them separate or binary , Go - there and then the {disfmarker} the possibilities of how to go there because {disfmarker}
Professor B: OK , that 's {disfmarker} let 's start that way .
Grad A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Professor B: s and so I {disfmarker} I don't yet know how to do this , I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: So that {disfmarker} that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse , and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for
Grad E: We {disfmarker} we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint .
Professor B: Of {disfmarker} of course .
Grad E: Identified that
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad E: and so again re that 's completely correct , we have the user model , the situation model here , we don't have the discourse model here yet . Much the same way as we didn't {disfmarker} we don't have the ontology here .
Professor B: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth .
Grad E: Really .
Professor B: So in some sense it 's {disfmarker} it 's there .
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet .
Grad E: Yeah . Um This be specific for second year ? Um And {disfmarker} and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint .
Professor B: But if we do it 'll have the three values .
Grad E: Hmm ?
Professor B: It 'll have the EVA values if {disfmarker} if we have it .
Grad E: Yeah . Yeah . OK just for starters and here discourse um
Professor B: For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . That 's what we talked about .
Grad E: um well , I think um we 're looking at the {disfmarker} the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Grad E: So this should sort of push it in one direction
Professor B: Right .
Grad D: Yeah , I mean , see I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm thinking that any node that begins with "" Go - there "" is either gonna be true or false .
Grad A: Well , what {disfmarker} Whoops .
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad A: Right .
Professor B: Ah . I see that could be .
Grad A: Also , that node , I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Grad A: you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the
Professor B: Could be . Yeah . N
Grad D: Like situation traffic and so on .
Grad A: Yeah , the time of day .
Professor B: Yeah . Yeah . So {disfmarker} so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision
Grad D: I guess the final
Professor B: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node . And I {disfmarker} don't worry about layout ,
Grad D: Yeah .
Professor B: I mean then we 'll go {disfmarker} we 'll go nuts but
Grad D: Mmm .
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Grad D: Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into ?
Professor B: Could be , yeah .
Grad D: Right . Because that 's what we , I mean that 's why this situation comes up .
Professor B: Yeah . Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed {disfmarker} feed into the Go - there S That 's right ,
Grad D: Yeah , right .
Professor B: so the Endpoint node ,
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: make that up t t to the Go - there then
Grad E: Yeah .
Professor B: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that . Now it 's gonna be important not to have loops by the way . Uh really important in {disfmarker} in the belief worl net world not to have loops

What did Grad E say when discussing Go-there decision?|Grad E first started the topic about Go-there decision, and then proposed the question about how to represent discourse.

Professor B: So in some sense it 's {disfmarker} it 's there .
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet .
Grad E: Yeah . Um This be specific for second year ? Um And {disfmarker} and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint .
Professor B: But if we do it 'll have the three values .
Grad E: Hmm ?
Professor B: It 'll have the EVA values if {disfmarker} if we have it .
Grad E: Yeah . Yeah . OK just for starters and here discourse um
Professor B: For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . That 's what we talked about .
Grad E: um well , I think um we 're looking at the {disfmarker} the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Grad E: So this should sort of push it in one direction
Professor B: Right .
Professor B: And then also the discourse endpoint , I {disfmarker} I guess endpoint sub - D is {disfmarker} if you wanna make it consistent .
Grad C: Wh - ah .
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Grad A: Um actually is this the {disfmarker} the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because isn't the , I mean
Professor B: I think so . S
Grad A: uh , hmm OK . But that still allows for the possibility of the {disfmarker} of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from {disfmarker}
Professor B: Maybe not , a Right .
Grad A: That {disfmarker} all that {disfmarker} that kind of decision making happens at the Go - there node .
Professor B: Uh y you {disfmarker} yeah you {disfmarker} i you {disfmarker} if you needed to do that .
Grad A: Uh . If you needed it to do that .
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad A: But uh OK I was just thinking I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible {disfmarker} possible asking of the user
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad A: you know hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something
Professor B: Ah . Good point , I don't {disfmarker} I don't know how we 're going to {disfmarker} t uh
Grad A: or Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model but , you know , directly out of interaction .
Professor B: Right . Uh I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough .
Grad E: Yeah .
Professor B: Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things
Grad A: OK .
Professor B: you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ?
Grad A: Yeah .

Grad E: Yeah .
Professor B: S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption ,

Grad C: So I jus just to make sure I understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ?
Grad D: You 'd compute the weighted average , so the probability of E would be uh
Grad C: OK , so {disfmarker} so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh {comment} W one times {disfmarker}
Grad A: Point three .
Grad C: or A or {disfmarker} let 's see , one full quarter times point one

What did Grad D say about mixture of experts when discussing probability computation?|Grad D first said that different experts were reliable in different situations and it was necessary to organically combine them to make the network adapt to diverse situations. The network could be divided into several parts and the network would decide which of the experts would be trusted in this particular situation.

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: So , I will open our functional design meeting .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So , I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um
Industrial Designer: Industrial Design .
Marketing: Marketing Expert .
Project Manager: What's your talk ?
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Marketing Experts . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Um , so you're participant two ?
Industrial Designer: One one .
User Interface: No no no .
Project Manager: No you're {disfmarker}
User Interface: One .
Project Manager: No ,
Industrial Designer: Three three , it's three
Project Manager: I'm participant one . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: sorry {vocalsound} .
User Interface: I I think I'm a {gap} .
Project Manager: Okay , never mind .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: 'Kay , did you save your presentation ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: In one .
Industrial Designer: In one , sorry {vocalsound} .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Isn't that technical functions ?
Marketing: No sure .
Industrial Designer: So you didn't save it maybe .
Marketing: Uh
User Interface: It's mine .
Marketing: it's David Jordan . Course .
Industrial Designer: Alright , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Name's Jordan . So
Industrial Designer: David Jordan ? {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .
Project Manager: Uh .
Industrial Designer: Too great for email then .
User Interface: Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Hmm .
Project Manager: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: and to discuss it with uh the other members .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , hmm .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?
Marketing: Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker}
Marketing: So .
Project Manager: So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: It's is uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Lame , or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah .
Project Manager: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,
Project Manager: and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .
User Interface: Control . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm
Project Manager: because if we want to to do remote control
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?
User Interface: Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .
Project Manager: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
User Interface: Yeah . Okay .
Project Manager: And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .
User Interface: Mm-hm .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: of the uh of real reaction
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So .
Project Manager: and uh also {disfmarker}
Marketing: So has to be yellow .
Industrial Designer: Yellow .
Project Manager: Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
User Interface: Okay . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Require lot of requirements ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} For cheap {vocalsound} remote control , yeah .
Project Manager: but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah . And cheap .

What did the user interface designer and the industrial designer recommend to do when discussing the product requirement and why?|The user interface designer recommended to design a Google TV controller because Google was very successful for its powerful functions and friendly user interface. Also, to make the customers able to use the product without learning the manual, the industrial designer suggested applying some international standards such as some pictograms.|"['Project Manager: So , I will open our functional design meeting .', 'Marketing: Mm-hmm .', 'Project Manager: So , I will play role of the secretary .

User Interface: A low cost .
Project Manager: Yeah . But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This is {disfmarker}
Marketing: I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway .
Project Manager: Maybe not ,
Marketing: It's maybe more in browsing .
Project Manager: but mayb
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .
User Interface: Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: Ok
Marketing: Hm-mm .
User Interface: It's It's not so uh popular now . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: the global usage ,
User Interface: Global ,
Industrial Designer: so if people don't have the technology .
User Interface: okay .
Project Manager: So .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?
User Interface: So I I so {disfmarker} As as for the colour , what what do you think ?
Project Manager: I think it has to be yellow .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yellow ? {gap} T_V_ remote control ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Min
Project Manager: Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .
User Interface: Okay . Okay .

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .
Project Manager: What is this ?
Industrial Designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?
Marketing: What's the average price of this technology then ?
Industrial Designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the
User Interface: So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay .
Project Manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Hmm .
Project Manager: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: and to discuss it with uh the other members .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , hmm .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?
Marketing: Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker}
Marketing: So .
Project Manager: So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: It's is uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Lame , or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah .
Project Manager: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,
User Interface: A low cost .
Project Manager: Yeah . But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This is {disfmarker}
Marketing: I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway .
Project Manager: Maybe not ,
Marketing: It's maybe more in browsing .
Project Manager: but mayb
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .
User Interface: Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: Ok
Marketing: Hm-mm .
User Interface: It's It's not so uh popular now . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: the global usage ,
User Interface: Global ,
Industrial Designer: so if people don't have the technology .
User Interface: okay .
Project Manager: So .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?
User Interface: So I I so {disfmarker} As as for the colour , what what do you think ?
Project Manager: I think it has to be yellow .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yellow ? {gap} T_V_ remote control ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Min
Project Manager: Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be .

Summarize the discussion about the industrial design of the product.|The group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller because it was cheaper than a laser. Secondly, the industrial designer preferred a wireless remote control as it was easier to manage but the suggestion was doubted by the marketing and the project manager considering the cost and user requirements. Another thing was about the buttons. The marketing advised having less buttons because only ten percent of the buttons were actually in use and people tended to zap a lot.|"['Project Manager: So , I will open our functional design meeting .', 'Marketing: Mm-hmm .', 'Project Manager: So , I will play role of the secretary .

Project Manager: So , I will open our functional design meeting .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So , I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um
Industrial Designer: Industrial Design .
Marketing: Marketing Expert .
Project Manager: What's your talk ?
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Marketing Experts . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Um , so you're participant two ?
Industrial Designer: One one .
User Interface: No no no .
Project Manager: No you're {disfmarker}
User Interface: One .
Project Manager: No ,
Industrial Designer: Three three , it's three
Project Manager: I'm participant one . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: sorry {vocalsound} .
User Interface: I I think I'm a {gap} .
Project Manager: Okay , never mind .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: 'Kay , did you save your presentation ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: In one .
Industrial Designer: In one , sorry {vocalsound} .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Isn't that technical functions ?
Marketing: No sure .
Industrial Designer: So you didn't save it maybe .
Marketing: Uh
User Interface: It's mine .
Marketing: it's David Jordan . Course .
Industrial Designer: Alright , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Name's Jordan . So
Industrial Designer: David Jordan ? {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .
Project Manager: Uh .
Industrial Designer: Too great for email then .
User Interface: Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker}
Marketing: True .
Project Manager: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?
Industrial Designer: I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen ,
Marketing: What the cost is ?
Project Manager: yeah . The cost {disfmarker}
Marketing: Twelve , twelve a half .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .
Marketing: That might just {disfmarker} So .
Industrial Designer: You can go to the next slide .
Project Manager: Okay .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .
Project Manager: What is this ?
Industrial Designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?
Marketing: What's the average price of this technology then ?
Industrial Designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the
User Interface: So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can .

Why did the project manager disagree with the industrial designer when talking about whether to have a wireless control?|Firstly, the industrial designer said the wireless technology would cost 8 Euros which was higher than the manager's expectation. Secondly, whether the users would like to have a wireless control or not was unknown and the marketing would go to figure it out. Finally, having a link between the remote control and the television would prevent control from losing.|"['Project Manager: Yeah .', 'Industrial Designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .', 'Project Manager: What is this ?', 'Industrial Designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .', 'Project Manager: Okay .', 'Industrial Designer: Look .

Project Manager: What is this ?
Industrial Designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .

Marketing: What's the average price of this technology then ?
Industrial Designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the
User Interface: So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay .
Marketing: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah ,
User Interface: {vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: but {disfmarker}
Marketing: I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: but in a sense {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: sometime I want to have wire because you know .
Project Manager: Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?
Industrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?
Industrial Designer: Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .
Project Manager: Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: The wire ?
Project Manager: As it's {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . True .
Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah .
Project Manager: I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry .
Marketing: Now the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: just think of um the usability .
User Interface: Design a wireless remote control . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television ,
Marketing: Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True .
Project Manager: yeah .
Marketing: This you will see in my presentation then .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So I will let you to do your presentation , so .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Okay {vocalsound} .
Marketing: Which is participant four . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}

Marketing: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah ,
User Interface: {vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: but {disfmarker}
Marketing: I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: but in a sense {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: sometime I want to have wire because you know .
Project Manager: Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?
Industrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?
Industrial Designer: Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .
Project Manager: Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: The wire ?
Project Manager: As it's {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . True .
Industrial Designer: Okay , yeah .
Project Manager: I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,
User Interface: Functions .
Marketing: this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Sure ? Yeah ?
User Interface: Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons .
Project Manager: Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?
User Interface: But I'm not sure {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .
Marketing: Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the
Industrial Designer: The manuals .
Project Manager: Yeah ,
Marketing: manual .
Project Manager: I think the {disfmarker}
Marketing: It's {disfmarker}
User Interface: No you you can have a switch menu , so you can
Project Manager: Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .
User Interface: well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .
Project Manager: Yeah , okay . Okay ,
User Interface: Then you you put the switch button ,
Project Manager: but {disfmarker}
User Interface: then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .
Industrial Designer: With a {disfmarker}
User Interface: So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons .
Project Manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Hmm .
Project Manager: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: and to discuss it with uh the other members .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , hmm .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?
Marketing: Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker}
Marketing: So .
Project Manager: So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: It's is uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Lame , or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah .
Project Manager: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,

Summarize the discussion about product appearance.|Based on earlier experiments and questionnaires, the marketing found that seventy-five percent of the users thought most remote controls ugly. Thus, the group decided to make the product look fancy so that people would pay more. However, how to make remote control look fancy was a big problem because different people have different opinions about fancy. What's more, the project manager thought the product should be recognizable and attractive.|"['Project Manager: So , I will open our functional design meeting .', 'Marketing: Mm-hmm .', 'Project Manager: So , I will play role of the secretary .

Industrial Designer: Too great for email then .
User Interface: Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it .

Marketing: So .
Project Manager: So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control .

Project Manager: It's is uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Lame , or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah .
Project Manager: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,
Project Manager: and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .
User Interface: Control . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm
Project Manager: because if we want to to do remote control
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?
User Interface: Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .
Project Manager: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
User Interface: Yeah . Okay .
Project Manager: And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .
User Interface: Mm-hm .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: of the uh of real reaction
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So .
Project Manager: and uh also {disfmarker}
Marketing: So has to be yellow .
Industrial Designer: Yellow .
Project Manager: Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
User Interface: Okay . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Require lot of requirements ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} For cheap {vocalsound} remote control , yeah .
Project Manager: but {disfmarker}

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: So , I will open our functional design meeting .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So , I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um
Industrial Designer: Industrial Design .
Marketing: Marketing Expert .
Project Manager: What's your talk ?
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Marketing Experts . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Um , so you're participant two ?
Industrial Designer: One one .
User Interface: No no no .
Project Manager: No you're {disfmarker}
User Interface: One .
Project Manager: No ,
Industrial Designer: Three three , it's three
Project Manager: I'm participant one . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: sorry {vocalsound} .
User Interface: I I think I'm a {gap} .
Project Manager: Okay , never mind .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: 'Kay , did you save your presentation ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: In one .
Industrial Designer: In one , sorry {vocalsound} .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Isn't that technical functions ?
Marketing: No sure .
Industrial Designer: So you didn't save it maybe .
Marketing: Uh
User Interface: It's mine .
Marketing: it's David Jordan . Course .
Industrial Designer: Alright , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Name's Jordan . So
Industrial Designer: David Jordan ? {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .
Project Manager: Uh .
Industrial Designer: Too great for email then .
User Interface: Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny {disfmarker} look fancy , not funny .
Industrial Designer: Look fancy .
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: This is a question that should be asked to the {disfmarker} If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people {gap} .
User Interface: Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah , this is something we sh
User Interface: Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some {disfmarker} for other peoples , so .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: But this was first step and {disfmarker} This was the first step , yeah .
Industrial Designer: I think the solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .
Marketing: Specially distribution , yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .
Project Manager: If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , it will cost little bit more .
User Interface: Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah .
User Interface: some people prefer black remote control .
Marketing: Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .
Project Manager: And also f
User Interface: Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: so user can select which colour they prefer , so .
Project Manager: Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases ,
Marketing: Yeah ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow ,
Project Manager: So you have to {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: but just mm .
Project Manager: Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so .
User Interface: Okay , okay . Okay .
Project Manager: And also it has to be attractive , of course ,
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: because if you want to sale {disfmarker} to sell the remote control . It's okay ?
Marketing: Regarding the first line , what {disfmarker} So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: And that's it .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: But {disfmarker} I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me .
Marketing: It's already changed for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I think it would be simpler .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . Uh {disfmarker} Y you {disfmarker} You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um {disfmarker} pon
Marketing: Industrial Designer .
Industrial Designer: Industrial Designer , yeah . Component component , yeah .
Project Manager: yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: And Florent to work my subject .
Marketing: Yep .
Project Manager: And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: It's okay ?
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: I think the um session is closed .
Industrial Designer: Good .
Project Manager: And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . {vocalsound} Not in mine .
Industrial Designer: Okay {vocalsound} Okay , that's clear .
User Interface: Okay {vocalsound} . Okay . {vocalsound}

Industrial Designer: Too great for email then .
User Interface: Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Hmm .
Project Manager: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .

User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: It's is uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Lame , or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah .
Project Manager: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,
Project Manager: and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .
User Interface: Control . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm
Project Manager: because if we want to to do remote control
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?
User Interface: Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .
Project Manager: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
User Interface: Yeah . Okay .
Project Manager: And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .

Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: of the uh of real reaction
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So .
Project Manager: and uh also {disfmarker}
Marketing: So has to be yellow .
Industrial Designer: Yellow .
Project Manager: Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
User Interface: Okay . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Require lot of requirements ,

Summarize the discussion about petitions fraudulence, tax evasion, violence handling and their supervisory.|Mr. Dan Albas asked about the handling of fraudulence by the Canadian government but Right Hon. Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister, was saying that the government put giving support and help to Canadians in the first place. Then Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie questioned the reason why the government supported the profiteers for tax evasion when implementing the large employer emergency financing facility. However, Right Hon. Justin Trudeau thought they were making plans to help workers to survive this pandemic and was always their priority to overcome. Hon. Candice Bergen required that how they were dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada and put out a violence case that why the Liberals were making this gun illegal and What the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle was. It was demonstrated by Hon. Bill Blair that many Canadians were murdered by these guns which was their explanation of banning guns.|"[""Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's an honour to take the mike today, with all colleagues here. It's good to see you all virtually and safe. Petitioners in my community point out in this petition, which, of course, predates the pandemic, that the family doctor shortage is severe in this country. Nearly five million Canadians lack a regular family doctor. This problem is particularly profound in more rural areas, including, as the petitioners reference, the community in which I live, Sydney, British Columbia. We have a very significant crisis and a lack of family doctors. The petitioners call on the government to work with provinces and territories to find a collaborative, holistic solution so that every Canadian has a family doctor and we address the family doctor shortage."", ""Mr. Brad Vis (MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, CPC): Good morning, Mr. Chair.

The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed RCMP-vetted Canadians; to focus taxpayer dollars where they will actually increase public safety, which is on keeping at-risk youth from being involved in gangs and on anti-gang enforcement; and to provide our men and women in uniform at the Canada Border Services Agency with the resources they need to stop the flow of illegal guns into this country. Through this petition, my constituents take issue with how the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal weapons smugglers responsible for the violence in our communities.

Did the minister's office or the Prime Minister sign off on this memo?"", ""Mr. Dan Albas: That's not what I'm asking here, Mr. Chair. The Conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through. What we are asking about is fraud.

That's good. What's even better is that he announced that the loans would be tied to conditions. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Basically, we're talking about fraudsters. There are no conditions that would allow us to tighten the screws on profiteers. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the profiteers?"", ""Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. It's a priority of our government. There is no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs.

Our decision from the very beginning was to get the help out to people and figure out, with retroactive action if necessary, where and when there may have been fraudulent use. Our priority was getting that help out.
Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, this came from a memo issued by a deputy minister. Did the minister's office or the Prime Minister sign off on this memo?
Mr. Dan Albas: That's not what I'm asking here, Mr. Chair. The Conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through. What we are asking about is fraud. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. Can the Prime Minister at least confirm that this will happen?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. We will do that. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. That's what we're focused on.
The Chair: We'll now continue with Mr.Ste-Marie.
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie (Joliette, BQ): Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. That's good. What's even better is that he announced that the loans would be tied to conditions. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Basically, we're talking about fraudsters. There are no conditions that would allow us to tighten the screws on profiteers. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the profiteers?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. It's a priority of our government. There is no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. That's why we are introducing measures that support workers, who will continue to be our priority.

What did Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie mean by saying that the Prime Minister continued to support the profiteers?|Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie first asked the prime minister whether the government would outlaw what was immoral and then, put it precisely, made an example that a bank relocated its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and registered them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven.

Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, I asked a very simple question. Did the Prime Minister or his minister sign off on this memo that was issued by the deputy minister, yes or no?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we have been focused entirely on getting help to Canadians when they need it, and that has meant that yes, there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix, but getting that help into Canadians' pockets during this pandemic was our priority.
Mr. Dan Albas: I'm asking the Prime Minister to show some accountability. Did he or his office sign off on this memo?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, my office and I have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to Canadians. Perhaps, as Mr. Albas points out, other parties would have been slower to get the money out. We were flowing money to people who needed it.
Mr. Dan Albas: Mr. Chair, the question was quite simple. Obviously the Prime Minister doesn't seem comfortable with the answer. Will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud, or will he write them off, as the story said?
Right Hon.

Summarize the discussion about Government support for the elderly and for vulnerable people.|During the pandemic of Covid-19, the government should fix this gap so that the single parents and their children could get the support they need. Also, matching funds and adequate housing should be given to support the affected in Canada.

Ms. Jenny Kwan: That does not replace spousal support and child maintenance, Prime Minister. Across the country there is no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic, leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19. Canadians who are homeless or living in substandard housing have no access to bathroom facilities for basic hygiene. Those living in crowded SROs and shelters cannot practise social distancing.

While the B.C. government has implemented an initiative to house some of the homeless population in empty hotels in the short term, support from the federal government is needed to secure permanent solutions post-COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister commit to providing matching funds and take the right to adequate housing seriously?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: I know that the honourable member wouldn't want to inadvertently mislead the House. The fact is, the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of COVID-19.

Old folks are being left in soiled clothing and are going without baths for weeks. They are packed four to a room in dangerously unhealthy conditions. The situation is so bad that the armed forces had to be called in to intervene. To the Minister of Health, is her government prepared to take strong action to address this crisis in seniors health care?

What did Ms. Jenny Kwan mean by saying there was a gap between program making and its implementation?|Ms. Jenny Kwan gave an example that a single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. She paid taxes on her spousal income, but she was not eligible for CERB. That meant a complicated program delivered by the government that left many people behind, and more importantly, there was no action reacting to it. So Ms. Jenny Kwan called for a fixation for this gap and proposed that matching funding and adequate housing should be arranged for those who were affected.|"['Right Hon.

Many seniors who were facing extra dispensing fees were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic. It was so important that the government be there to support them. The government announced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for seniors eligible for GIS. This meant there would be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time.

Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors): Thank you very much. There is definitely an interest in and support for our seniors. We've been working to support seniors since the very beginning of this pandemic. I've just had the opportunity to introduce additional measures today wherein we are introducing a one-time special payment for those who receive OAS.
Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: Nearly two months into living in some form of isolation, watching their retirement savings take a hit and having to take additional health precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eligible seniors are set to receive a one-time payment of up to $500. Why does this government consistently undervalue seniors compared with everyone else?
Hon. Deb Schulte: I just want to make sure that my honourable colleague remembers that we have already given a GST top-up of almost $375 for single seniors and over $500 for couples. This is in addition to what we've just done today where, as you said, it's $500.
Mrs. Stephanie Kusie: According to Abacus Data, 69% of Canadians feel that there will be a second wave in the pandemic, and 52% of Canadians believe that there is a shortage of medical equipment, including personal protective equipment.

Summarize the discussion about Government support for energy resources and tourism and funding in green economy and small businesses.|Since Quebec was Canada's biggest producer of hydroelectricity, renewable energy sharing through an energy corridor was very essential for different areas in Canada. And as a hard-hit sector, tourism needed much support from the Canadian government. The government was going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions would be ready when the economy reopened. When it came to the green economy, the government now gave priority to the virus and making through this disaster. Also, they paid much attention to the small businesses and carried out measures to help them out.|"[""Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Mr. Chair, Canada's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people, including 11,000 indigenous people, in every part of Canada. It is essential that we support those businesses. It is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan. We have provided supports for those businesses, and we will continue to do so, also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds."", ""Mr. David Yurdiga: Mr. Chair, western Canada oil storage is under extreme pressure. If thermal projects such as SAGD are shut down, those facilities could be lost forever. If the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production, what is the government's plan to ensure Canada's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production?"", ""Hon. Seamus O'Regan: Mr. Chair, we have worked with industry and with provinces on every front to ensure the stability of the oil and gas sector of our country. We have concentrated on workers. We need the workers in our oil and gas sector in order to lower emissions and achieve a greener economy. We need their determination and their ingenuity. We need to make sure that their jobs are held whole. Therefore, we are looking after workers and we are looking out for companies that hold onto those jobs for those workers."", ""Mr. David Yurdiga: Mr. Chair, the government's assistance package for the Canadian oil and gas industry provides some hope to the industry.

Certainly at this time, Canadians are most particularly focused on ensuring that support is provided so that they can put food on the table and pay their rent. We are starting to focus on the relaxation measures in many provinces and territories in Canada. That is the primary focus of the government, as it is of Canadians.

Obviously, rent and landlord-tenant relations are under provincial jurisdiction. At every opportunity I talk to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there. We will continue to support small businesses. We believe this program has significant merit.

What was the current situation of the tourism sector and what was the government going to do?|The current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of Canada's tourism industry. And the pain would be felt by thousands of Canadians, who would have to find new jobs in order to survive. Let's work together to find ways to get this hard-hit sector moving again. Many people had lost their jobs and needed assistance from the government. That was why they were here, providing a helping hand at this difficult time so they could come out the other side.|"[""Mr. Dan Albas: That's not what I'm asking here, Mr. Chair. The Conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through. What we are asking about is fraud. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. Can the Prime Minister at least confirm that this will happen?"", ""Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. We will do that. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. That's what we're focused on."", ""The Chair: We'll now continue with Mr.Ste-Marie."", ""Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie (Joliette, BQ): Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. That's good. What's even better is that he announced that the loans would be tied to conditions. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Basically, we're talking about fraudsters. There are no conditions that would allow us to tighten the screws on profiteers. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the profiteers?"", ""Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. It's a priority of our government. There is no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. That's why we are introducing measures that support workers, who will continue to be our priority."", ""Mr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr.Chair, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals are having to deal with considerable losses of income. In my constituency, tens of thousands of tourists use the ferry between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. What is the government planning to do to help the ferry to survive and to resume service next season, if the borders remain closed this summer?"", ""Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages): I have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague Mr.d'Entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country, and particularly in the Atlantic region. In light of the new funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, I will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector."", 'Hon. Maryam Monsef: Yes, we are, Mr. Chair.', ""Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of Canada's tourism industry.

Meeting Transcript:
Mr. Dan Albas: That's not what I'm asking here, Mr. Chair. The Conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through. What we are asking about is fraud. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. Can the Prime Minister at least confirm that this will happen?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. We will do that. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. That's what we're focused on.
The Chair: We'll now continue with Mr.Ste-Marie.
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie (Joliette, BQ): Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. That's good. What's even better is that he announced that the loans would be tied to conditions. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Basically, we're talking about fraudsters. There are no conditions that would allow us to tighten the screws on profiteers. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the profiteers?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. It's a priority of our government. There is no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. That's why we are introducing measures that support workers, who will continue to be our priority.
Mr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr.Chair, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals are having to deal with considerable losses of income. In my constituency, tens of thousands of tourists use the ferry between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. What is the government planning to do to help the ferry to survive and to resume service next season, if the borders remain closed this summer?
Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages): I have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague Mr.d'Entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country, and particularly in the Atlantic region. In light of the new funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, I will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector.
Hon. Maryam Monsef: Yes, we are, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Jacques Gourde: Mr.Chair, the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of Canada's tourism industry. The pain will be felt by thousands of Canadians, who will have to find new jobs in order to survive. Is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens?
Hon. Mlanie Joly: Yes.
Mr. Bruce Stanton: Ms. Joly, you have to switch to the French channel and turn on your microphone.
Hon. Mlanie Joly: Yes, I look forward to working with my fellow member on this issue. I know the tourism sector is important to him and, especially, his constituents. Let's work together to find ways to get this hard-hit sector moving again. Many people have lost their jobs and need assistance from the government. That is why we're here, providing a helping hand at this difficult time so they can come out the other side.
The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Continuing with questions, we'll go to the honourable member for SaskatoonUniversity, Mr. Tochor.
Mr. Corey Tochor (SaskatoonUniversity, CPC): Good afternoon, everybody. With respect to entering Canada, does the government consider spousal reunification as essential travel, yes or no?
The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable minister.
Hon. Bill Blair: The CBSA has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-Canadian citizen, who has no status in Canada, attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential. They are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel.

What did the Canadian government do to help small businesses out?|They shared the member's concern that small businesses be supported. That's why they've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance. With respect to rent support, they were encouraging landlords to support this measure. Obviously, rent and landlord-tenant relations were under provincial jurisdiction. At every opportunity Hon. Bill Morneau talked to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there. They would continue to support small businesses. It allowed for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75% of the rent. It was a sound program and would require the provinces to step forward and enforce it.|"[""Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Thank you, Mr.Chair. We know that our approach has to help small and medium-size companies, but also large companies in order to provide a bridge to the end of the crisis. In our opinion, that is very important. It will protect the jobs of Canadians and the future of our economy. That's why the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility is very important. That said, we know that it is necessary and important to impose conditions. Yes, we do want to make sure that the facility is available for companies that are going to continue to support our economy, to protect their employees, and to make a significant contribution to our communities. That is why we have attached a number of major conditions to our approach. We will have more details on the subject in the coming days. We established from the outset that we had to impose conditions on executive compensation. That is very important. We are going to consider the rules and conditions that are needed in order for the facility to be available to the companies, the operations and the employees. Of course, conditions are required to ensure that the facility is available for operations, not for dividends or share buybacks, for example. We will impose conditions of that kind.

Summarize the discussion about things including fishing and tourism, oil and gas affected by the Covid-19.|During the pandemic, the lobster fishery was being negatively affected and was facing losses of up to 95% of its Asian markets. Many fishermen had their wives, their sons, their uncles or their fathers working for them, and sometimes it was the whole family on the boat. Moreover, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals were having to deal with considerable losses of income. As for oil and gas, western Canada oil storage is under extreme pressure. If thermal projects such as SAGD are shut down, those facilities could be lost forever.

What did the stress faced by oil and gas?|The oil and gas industry was under severe strain. Over the past number of years, they had seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down. The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the Bill C-69, which would prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry. These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels. To compound Alberta's economic problems, we have an international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a huge drop in demand for oil.|"[""Hon. Seamus O'Regan (Minister of Natural Resources): Mr. Chair, I'm happy that we were able to announce today some liquidity measures for large cap corporations in the oil and gas sector. These measures will provide them with the liquidity that they needed, and this is also the liquidity that they asked for. It was on April 17 that we started liquidity measures for small and medium-sized businesses in the oil and gas industry, and those are the ones in which 85% of workers are affected. Today's measures will complete that.

What did Marketing think of making spongy remote when presenting the market trend?|When User Interface asked the group how to make the spongy remote, Marketing thought about changeable fronts and some basic colour fronts because a fancy look was the most important thing for remote control. So they could make five different fronts to start with. Marketing also mentioned that it could be round, different from a normal remote control.|"['User Interface: Yeah , more .', 'Industrial Designer: Hmm .', 'Marketing: We have to discuss about it s uh {disfmarker} Okay , uh {gap}', 'Project Manager: Okay .', ""User Interface: Well , I'll I'll get back on it ."", ""Marketing: features not uh do not exist in current remote controls .

Marketing: The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .
User Interface: Yeah , okay . That {disfmarker} Uh fruit and veg , or {disfmarker}
Marketing: And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .
User Interface: Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers .
Marketing: Uh yeah i Just {disfmarker} Just on front .
User Interface: So you can {gap} the the spongy {disfmarker} yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control .
Project Manager: No .
Marketing: Neith uh I don't like it uh neither .
Project Manager: No . {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface: I just can't imagine it .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So just hard plastic ?
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , I think .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: Titanium . It's mentioned here uh .
Industrial Designer: Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .
Project Manager: But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit
Industrial Designer: Yeah ,
Project Manager: more rounded .
Industrial Designer: you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth .
Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , that's right .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger .
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: We already know that . Just a normal battery .
User Interface: Yeah . We have batteries .
Project Manager: Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Regular .
User Interface: You've more {gap} there as well .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .
User Interface: It wasn't very small one . {gap} very simple .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: That is for elderly .
Project Manager: So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I don't know .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: And you have the scroll button inside . {gap} Okay .
User Interface: Yes . Just a simple scrollb
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of {disfmarker} Skip that one as well .
User Interface: Doesn't have to be .
Project Manager: Okay . Yeah , it's cool .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , though that's a trend . If we want to make it . But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh the t the trend is
Project Manager: Rubber spongy .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: spongy and fruity .
User Interface: Yeah . No . Spongy
Marketing: But yeah .
Industrial Designer: Spongeball kinda .
User Interface: and {disfmarker}
Marketing: It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Okay . Yeah ,

Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Okay ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .

Project Manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the {gap} remote control ?
User Interface: How are you gonna make it ?
Project Manager: R_ soft .
Industrial Designer: Yeah ,
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Okay ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And uh some basic uh colour fronts . {vocalsound} Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . {vocalsound} Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget .
User Interface: Yeah , I'll get back on that .
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It's very uh difficult to to to do it .
Marketing: Intro
Project Manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Well ,
Marketing: Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem .
User Interface: I got f also an email from the the technology department .
Marketing: So {disfmarker} Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .
User Interface: They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: I'll check what they exact mean .
Marketing: Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .
User Interface: Yeah okay . So we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well we can {disfmarker} I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .
Project Manager: Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .
User Interface: More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out {disfmarker} both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
User Interface: It's the most important part , I think . But {disfmarker} And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .
Project Manager: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel
User Interface: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,
Project Manager: No .
User Interface: but it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: No , I don't uh {disfmarker} I don't like it .
User Interface: Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
User Interface: and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . {vocalsound} And I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But it {disfmarker} That's on on the display .
User Interface: No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .
Project Manager: Yeah , five . Let's give five .
User Interface: {gap}
Marketing: Or more or {disfmarker}
User Interface: Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: And um uh {vocalsound} uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic .
User Interface: Yeah . Um
Marketing: Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project .
User Interface: I think {disfmarker} Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh .
Industrial Designer: No , tha that will be {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ?
User Interface: Yes .
Project Manager: So you could put it like that ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , so top down .
Project Manager: okay .
Industrial Designer: Hmm ?
Marketing: Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station .
Industrial Designer: Do we have to design that w as well ?
Marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh I'm not sure .
Industrial Designer: The docking station ?
User Interface: Yeah , I think so .
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
User Interface: But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least .
Marketing: Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , just a recharger .
User Interface: Yeah , just where you're around something . Li Yeah , we had one example .
Industrial Designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .
User Interface: Mm . Mm .
Marketing: Yeah ,
User Interface: Which w
Marketing: but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then .
User Interface: Here you see one that's very round .
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah , okay .
User Interface: So I think that can be all kind of shapes .
Project Manager: But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . That's all .
Industrial Designer: Of the remote control ?
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Just round it up {gap} .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod {gap} . But {disfmarker}

What was the conclusion about choosing a regular chip or an advanced chip inside the speech recognition when discussing the remote features?|Marketing emphasized on the importance of technology innovation. So Project Manager suggested putting the speech recognition in the remote directly and they would need an advanced chip. The group agreed on it and Industrial Designer supplemented that the division had developed a new and inexpensive speech recognition feature: the integrated programmable sample sensor, indicating that the cost would not be too much.|"[""Industrial Designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost .

Industrial Designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap
User Interface: Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: and it's easy to implement .
User Interface: th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so {disfmarker} Um but uh
Marketing: {gap}
User Interface: if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .
Marketing: Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Since you have to uh configure speech thing .
Project Manager: But that's definitely more expensive than {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .
Marketing: Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be {gap} .
Project Manager: Yeah , but a telephone {gap} {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .
User Interface: Yeah , so uh we gotta de
Project Manager: So uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: We have to decide on that .
Marketing: Yeah . Okay . That was this ?
User Interface: Mm uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Oh I got an email uh {disfmarker} And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So
User Interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: it's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip .
User Interface: Okay . And speech recognition ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , probably too .
User Interface: Advanced {gap} . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but {disfmarker}
User Interface: I'll I'll give you my design .
Project Manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well ,
Marketing: Yeah . But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: okay ?
User Interface: So
Marketing: {vocalsound} Ma
User Interface: shall we {gap} it open then ?
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: So we can put all the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: The function of that in there . Yeah .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: And we need a {disfmarker} Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .
Industrial Designer: Fine . Yeah , we probably do .
Project Manager: But it doesn't say anything about it ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: does it ?
Industrial Designer: No .
User Interface: Oh yeah , I {disfmarker}
Marketing: But we don't have any f information about the cost .
User Interface: No .
Marketing: We started with information about the cost was now th
User Interface: I just I just received the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: And how much is the chip ? The the the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I don't know how much , but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .
Industrial Designer: Just in inexpensive or {disfmarker}
User Interface: This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .
Marketing: And how how does it work ? Is it {disfmarker}
User Interface: Doesn't say . Just {disfmarker} You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . Because uh {disfmarker} So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning .
Project Manager: It doesn't has to say anything . Just {disfmarker} You have to just talk to {disfmarker}
Marketing: No .
User Interface: Yeah uh th that's just {disfmarker} It's a {disfmarker}
Marketing: Does it say does it say something back ?
User Interface: No . Yeah , it {disfmarker} Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it .
Project Manager: Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But i it's a separate chip .
User Interface: I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I don't know anything about this ,
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , we just decide not to put it in ,
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker} Nah .
Project Manager: because it's too difficult .
Industrial Designer: I dunno . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well it it would be would be a good feature feature .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We have to stop now .

Meeting Transcript:
Professor F: Yeah . Great idea . I was gonna ask Adam to , uh , say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff because {vocalsound} it occurred to me that this is late May and the DARPA meeting is in {pause} mid July . Uh , but {vocalsound} I don't remember w what we {disfmarker} I know that we were gonna do something with the transcriber interface is one thing , but I thought there was a second thing . Anybody remember ?
PhD G: Well , we were gonna do a mock - up , like , question answering or something , I thought , that was totally separate from the interface . Do you remember ? Remember , like , asking questions and retrieving , {vocalsound} but in a pre - stored fashion .
Professor F: Mm - hmm . Right .
PhD G: That was the thing we talked about , I think , before the transcriber {disfmarker}
Professor F: Yeah .
PhD G: Come on in .
Professor F: Alright . So anyway , you have to sort out that out and get somebody going on it cuz we 're {disfmarker} got a {disfmarker} got a month left basically . So .
PhD G: You like these . Right ? OK , good .
Professor F: OK . Um OK . So , what are we g else we got ? You got {disfmarker} you just wrote a bunch of stuff .
PhD G: No . That was all , um , previously here .
Professor F: Oh .
PhD G: I was writing {pause} the digits and then I realized I could xerox them ,
Professor F: Oh , oh .
PhD G: because I didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones . So . We all , by the way , have the same digit form , for the record . So .
Professor F: That 's cool .
PhD G: Yeah .
Professor F: So , the choice is , uh , which {disfmarker} which do we want more , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the comparison , uh , {vocalsound} of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that {disfmarker} ?
Postdoc A: Um , interesting idea . In principle , I {disfmarker} I would say yes , although I still am doing some {disfmarker} the final - pass editing , trying to convert it over to the master file as the {disfmarker} being the channelized version and it 's {disfmarker} Yeah , it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes {comment} and I have to stop . Cleaning up the things like the , uh , uh , places where the transcriber was uncertain , and {disfmarker} and doing spot - checking here and there . So , um , uh , I guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done , um , but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Professor F: Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as I did with the , uh , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline .
Postdoc A: Yeah .
Professor F: Um , we are gonna have this DARPA {pause} meeting in the middle of July ,
Postdoc A: Yes .
Professor F: and I think it w it 'd be {disfmarker} given that we 've been {disfmarker} we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . Um .
Postdoc A: It 'll certainly be done by then . Yeah .
Professor F: Right . So we can s we {disfmarker} we wanna be able to say "" here is a subset that is available right now ""
Postdoc A: Mm - hmm . That 's right .
Professor F: and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth .
Postdoc A: That 's right .
Professor F: So .
Postdoc A: Yeah . That 's right . So that {disfmarker}
Professor F: OK ?
Postdoc A: OK .
Professor F: So , by {disfmarker} before July .
PhD C: And they don't have to approve , you know , th an edited version , they can just give their approval to whatever version
Postdoc A: Mm - hmm .
Professor F: And I don't remember how we ended up .
PhD G: I mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . And , I mean , I would say "" no "" . Like , I don't wanna know , but some people might be really {vocalsound} interested and then y In other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that .
Professor F: You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were {disfmarker}
PhD G: Well , {vocalsound} I don't know what happened to the small heads thing , but I j {vocalsound} Um , I 'm just saying that , like , you know , you can sort of say that any things that are deemed {disfmarker}
Professor F: They disappeared from view .
PhD G: Anyway . I mean , I agree that at some point people {vocalsound} probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes and then they could be asked for their consent , I guess , if {disfmarker} if those change . Cuz assumi {vocalsound} assuming we {disfmarker} we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway .
PhD C: Tha That 's {disfmarker} How about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ?
PhD G: Oh , my God .
Postdoc A: That would be simpler ,
Professor F: Uh .
Postdoc A: if we could count on them listening .
PhD G: But no one will listen to the hours and hours of {disfmarker}
PhD D: Talk .
PhD C: Well , that 's O K .
Grad B: That 's {disfmarker}

Meeting Transcript:
PhD C: Because in all our previous experiments , we had the {disfmarker} uh , you know , we were essentially cheating by having the , um , you know , the h the hand - segmentations as the basis of the recognition .
Professor F: Mm - hmm .
PhD C: And so now with Thilo 's segmenter working so well , I think we should {pause} consider doing a {disfmarker}
PhD E: Mmm . So .
Grad B: Come on .
PhD C: uh , doing {disfmarker}
PhD E: Yeah . We {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}
Professor F: Y think {disfmarker} you think we should increase the error rate .
PhD E: Anyway . Yeah .
PhD C: Yeah .
PhD E: Yeah .
Professor F: Good .
PhD C: Yeah .
Professor F: Yeah .
PhD E: That - that 's what I wanted to do anyway ,
PhD C: Yeah .
PhD E: so we should just get together and {disfmarker}
PhD G: Yeah .
PhD C: Yeah .
PhD G: And even {disfmarker} The good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , {comment} even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , uh , transients and things that come from the microphones ,
PhD C: Right .
PhD E: Yeah . Yeah .
PhD G: but {vocalsound} I know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform , we do very poorly because we 're {disfmarker} we 're getting insertions in places what {disfmarker} that you may well be cutting out .
PhD C: Well {disfmarker}
PhD E: Yeah .
Professor F: Mm - hmm .
PhD G: So we do need some kind of pre - segmentation .
PhD C: We should {disfmarker} we should consider doing some extra things , like , um , you know , retraining or adapting the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the models for background noise to the {disfmarker} to this environment , for instance .
PhD G: Mmm . Yeah .
PhD G: It 'd be great , too , if , um , we can {disfmarker} we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand {disfmarker} to experiment with , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , to have a ground truth for this segmentation work , which {disfmarker} I guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more .
PhD E: Mmm , yeah . That was a thing I {disfmarker} I planned working on , is , uh , to use the {disfmarker} the transcriptions which are done by now , and to {disfmarker} to use them as , uh {disfmarker}
PhD G: Oh . Oh , the new ones
PhD E: Yeah .
PhD G: with the tighter boundaries . Yeah .
PhD E: Yeah . And to use them for {disfmarker} for training a {disfmarker} or for {disfmarker} fo whatever . Yeah . To {disfmarker} to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , and {disfmarker} Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that 's a thing w was {disfmarker} w what I 'm just looking into .
PhD G: OK .
Postdoc A: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pre - segmentations are so much {disfmarker} are s so extremely helpful . Now there was , uh , I g guess {disfmarker} So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation {disfmarker} f for just very few days you were away . But it happened to be during that time I needed one ,
PhD E: Yeah .
Postdoc A: so I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and , um , they , um {disfmarker} you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . And he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um {disfmarker} Um . So they really appreciate it . But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while . You know , once in a while there 's something like ,
Postdoc A: um , and e Actually you talked to them . Didn't you ? Did you ? Have you {disfmarker} ?
PhD E: Yeah . I talked to Helen .
Postdoc A: And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and she was {disfmarker} And so , I asked her {disfmarker} I mean , They 're very perceptive . I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers . I haven't done it yet , but I wanna do that and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns . Um , cuz she was saying , you know , in a {disfmarker} in a span of very short period {disfmarker} we asked {disfmarker} It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these things , and she was saying the short utterances , uh , the , um {disfmarker}
PhD G: Hmm .
PhD E: Mmm . Yeah .
Postdoc A: you know , I mean , you 're {disfmarker} You 're aware of this . But {disfmarker} but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver
PhD E: Yeah .
Postdoc A: and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries . So .
PhD G: That 's great .
Postdoc A: Um . Yeah . I think it 'd be interesting to combine these .
PhD E: Yeah .
PhD G: Is there actually a record of where they change ? I mean , you can compare , do a diff on the {disfmarker} just so that we {vocalsound} knew {disfmarker}
Postdoc A: You could do it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's complicated in that {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} hhh , i hhh , i
PhD E: Yeah . Actually , when {disfmarker} when they create new {disfmarker} yeah , new segments or something , it will be , uh , not that easy but {disfmarker} hmm . I think {pause} one could do that .

Postdoc A: Um . Yeah . I think it 'd be interesting to combine these .
PhD E: Yeah .
PhD G: Is there actually a record of where they change ? I mean , you can compare , do a diff on the {disfmarker} just so that we {vocalsound} knew {disfmarker}
Postdoc A: You could do it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's complicated in that {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} hhh , i hhh , i
PhD E: Yeah . Actually , when {disfmarker} when they create new {disfmarker} yeah , new segments or something , it will be , uh , not that easy but {disfmarker} hmm . I think {pause} one could do that .


Question: What change has occurred to the segmenter?

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: So we can start ?
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Suppose I have to do my presentation . {vocalsound} Eh um {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Ah okay . It's Ada Longmund ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . So um we will have to um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . Record . So the project method is the following . So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: The tool training is to try out the white board , so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Maybe someone ha we have to {gap} this whiteboard ,
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: yeah ?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe you can draw your favourite animal
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and make a list of its favourite characteristics .
Marketing: So right now ?
Project Manager: I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later .
User Interface: So yeah I think you can do it . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I don't know .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Twenty five Euros ?
Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: I think it's quite good price , yeah .
Industrial Designer: I it's it's reasonable , s quite {disfmarker} yeah . Twenty five .
Marketing: It's reasonable , I think , yeah .
Project Manager: And uh
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: it will uh be a an international remote control ,
Project Manager: as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um {disfmarker} with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with {vocalsound} remote const con controls ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: try to create something new and people would like to to buy . And {vocalsound} and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know {disfmarker} I suppose you know what you have to do . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . I I hope so {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
Marketing: Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yep .
Marketing: and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I_D_ ,
Marketing: okay .
Project Manager: yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ?
Marketing: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer ,
User Interface: That's me .
Marketing: Okay ,
Industrial Designer: yeah ?
Marketing: and Marketing Expert , it's me .
Industrial Designer: AMI yeah project .
Project Manager: So I will manage all all the group .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} you will be the manager {vocalsound} yeah {vocalsound}
Marketing: You can manage all this , yeah .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Good .
Project Manager: So you have questions ?
Marketing: Um . Not really .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: you all know what the parts of the work you have to do .
Marketing: So which {disfmarker} you , the Industrial Designer .
User Interface: No I'm user interf I'm user interface design .
Marketing: Oh , okay , okay . Not the other one .
Industrial Designer: So .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay . So and the marketing expert will {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have
Project Manager: And {disfmarker}
Marketing: and then thi this would {vocalsound} I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .
Project Manager: yeah .
Industrial Designer: Ok Okay .
Project Manager: And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . So you don't have to do something really specific ,
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: as everybody everybody will have to use it ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: it's sor the same as keyboards . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard ,
User Interface: Yeah . Mm .
Project Manager: so really the remote control to be international .
User Interface: Yeah . Okay .
Project Manager: And not too expensive .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Yeah . And uh simple .
Project Manager: As we want to maximise the benefit .
User Interface: And easy to use .
Marketing: And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros .
User Interface: Ah , yeah .
Industrial Designer: It should be {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's the problem .
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Project Manager: And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So , is it okay ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm . It's clear .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know .

Industrial Designer: I I think the user the user interface design is {disfmarker} he will design how the user will you know {disfmarker} the relation between the user and you know the remote control so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Use it . Make make {disfmarker} yeah .
Industrial Designer: And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .
User Interface: Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . So the materi
User Interface: I design the user f user interface , you design the function .
Project Manager: Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay right . But {disfmarker} I was thinking that he's a user {disfmarker} 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .
User Interface: Yeah yeah .
Industrial Designer: But I don't know . {vocalsound} Okay .
Marketing: Well . You know .
Marketing: Oh , okay , okay . Not the other one .
Industrial Designer: So .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay . So and the marketing expert will {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have
Project Manager: And {disfmarker}
Marketing: and then thi this would {vocalsound} I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .
Project Manager: yeah .
Industrial Designer: Ok Okay .
Project Manager: And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . So you don't have to do something really specific ,
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: as everybody everybody will have to use it ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: it's sor the same as keyboards . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard ,
User Interface: Yeah . Mm .
Project Manager: so really the remote control to be international .
User Interface: Yeah . Okay .
Project Manager: And not too expensive .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Yeah . And uh simple .
Project Manager: As we want to maximise the benefit .
User Interface: And easy to use .
Marketing: And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros .
User Interface: Ah , yeah .
Industrial Designer: It should be {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's the problem .
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Project Manager: And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So , is it okay ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm . It's clear .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know .
Marketing: Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal .
Industrial Designer: Transfer . It's a dog in a village . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So what are you sug going to do now ? {gap}
Marketing: I think it's done .
Project Manager: Yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It's done ?
Project Manager: yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Just have to {disfmarker} present project ,
User Interface: So we have break .
Project Manager: discuss a little bit about it .
Industrial Designer: Oh my God .
Marketing: Oh , we have twenty five minutes for the meeting .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: So , if you have questions .
User Interface: Oh . Hmm .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Know what time is it ? No .
User Interface: No . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's okay ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's okay .
Project Manager: You know your job ? you know your job ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have an idea yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You know your job ?
Industrial Designer: I have an idea of my job {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} yeah so . Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .

Summarize the discussion about detailed design of the remote control.|There were two main parts in the detailed design. Firstly, the prototype presentation, Industrial Designer presented the design on the wheel, the button, and the base of the remote control. Secondly, Marketing presented eleven points to be evaluated based on the findings in marketing trend reports and company strategy marketing. Besides, the group had a point calculation on each evaluation criterion.|"[""Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting .

Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas .

Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}
User Interface: You could change the vegetable , or fruit .
Industrial Designer: yeah , I can change the vegetable .
Project Manager: Oh is that broccoli ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .
User Interface: It's been a l
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Oh yeah .
User Interface: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator . How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .
User Interface: Okay so that's just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere
User Interface: So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah we didn't design that .
User Interface: Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed .
Industrial Designer: But it would be coordinating with that of course .
User Interface: Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So . Tada .
Project Manager: Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . {vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}
User Interface: Which one is that again sorry ? Three point one ?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Yeah that {disfmarker} it's three point one was not that good . Four point one .
Project Manager: Does the shape {disfmarker}
Marketing: The shape .
User Interface: I think {disfmarker}
Marketing: Four point two ?
Project Manager: See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the {disfmarker} is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It {disfmarker} or bigger ?
Industrial Designer: I think the wheel would probably be {disfmarker} mm .
Project Manager: Because {disfmarker}
User Interface: What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And like then it {disfmarker} you could hold it in your hand better .
Industrial Designer: I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish .
Project Manager: Yeah . No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get {disfmarker} that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: The flat one . Yeah .
Project Manager: so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .
User Interface: I didn't {disfmarker} yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . Mm .
User Interface: But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah . And would it even resemble fruit that way ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah like certain ones {disfmarker} you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,

Summarize the discussion about changing an aspect of the remote.|Project Manager suggested that the group might need to discuss changing an aspect of the remote. According to the previous evaluation, the worst one was material. Thus, the group gave suggestions on the smallish size, smashed or resembled fruit shape, and printed patterns on rubber design. The group also suggested changing batteries, but they ended up agreeing that there were no problems in battery design.|"[""Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody .

Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}
User Interface: You could change the vegetable , or fruit .
Industrial Designer: yeah , I can change the vegetable .
Project Manager: Oh is that broccoli ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .
User Interface: It's been a l
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Oh yeah .
User Interface: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator . How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .
User Interface: Okay so that's just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere
User Interface: So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah we didn't design that .
User Interface: Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed .
Industrial Designer: But it would be coordinating with that of course .
User Interface: Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So . Tada .
Project Manager: Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . {vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}
Marketing: Two and one .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Sorry about that . T two point two , which is one point five .
Project Manager: One .
Industrial Designer: Uh three . Wait why did I put three ?
User Interface: Uh one .
Industrial Designer: I meant one on mine too .
Marketing: Okay . Three point one . Is that correct on my slide ?
Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah ?
User Interface: Uh one .
Industrial Designer: Three point one . I have four .
Project Manager: Three .
Marketing: One , four , three , three , three point two ?
Industrial Designer: Three .
Project Manager: Three .
User Interface: Uh . One .
Marketing: Three point three .
User Interface: One .
Industrial Designer: One .
Project Manager: Two .
Marketing: Four point one ?
User Interface: One .
Industrial Designer: Two .
Project Manager: Five .
Marketing: Two . Four point two .
User Interface: Two .
Industrial Designer: Three .
Project Manager: Four .
Marketing: Two and four point three .
Industrial Designer: Two .
Marketing: One , two .
User Interface: One .
Project Manager: Two .
Marketing: Right so I put one on that .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue .
Project Manager: Okay . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone .
Project Manager: No no that's um {disfmarker} I think we should look at the ones that {vocalsound} like where s where people said four , where {disfmarker} um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote .
Marketing: I didn't know how else to do it . Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Do {disfmarker} does every ones have the slide ?
Project Manager: The {disfmarker}
Marketing: Three point one .
Project Manager: that was material .
Marketing: Slide show . Material {vocalsound} technologically innovative , okay . Um ,
Project Manager: Mm .

Summarize the discussion about the process of the project.|Firstly, Project Manager asked about the room for creativity in fruit and squishiness. User Interface thought the prototype making was creatively stimulating and the product has met all the criteria. Next, Project Manager reflected on his leadership and management role in the group. Other members gave recognition to his performance and everyone's cooperation. Then, Project Manager asked about the convenience of the means for the materials and the pen used in the presentation. Group evaluated based on the user-friendly and the working efficiency.|"[""Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting .

User Interface: Um so uh I can't think of any {disfmarker} So we'll have to like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,
Industrial Designer: It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .
User Interface: but you could do like {disfmarker} Yeah that's true .
Project Manager: Yeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah that's true . Mm .
Industrial Designer: I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .
Project Manager: Yeah . Which is why printing might be like {disfmarker} just printing the fruit on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} fruit .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Hmm .
Project Manager: Mm . {vocalsound} Not really {disfmarker} Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . {vocalsound} Um so project evaluation .
Marketing: Do you want this and we can all {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .
Project Manager: I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied {disfmarker} oh , oh it's alright . Uh . Yeah .
Marketing: It's alright yeah ?
Project Manager: Um {disfmarker} Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Sure .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: I did .
Project Manager: I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Sponginess . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: The prototype making was very creatively stimulating
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And how was our leadership and teamwork ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .
Project Manager: Well I thought my leadership was crap personally .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Um .
User Interface: I think you were fine .
Project Manager: Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now .
User Interface: You did a good job leading .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together .
Marketing: Yeah we didn't {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} uh it all c sort of blended quite well .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like {vocalsound} I don't know , all had ideas about it but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah . Very democratic . No spats , that was good .
User Interface: {vocalsound} yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: No . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um and the means for like {disfmarker} the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I mean we used {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .
Project Manager: Are you a Mac person ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: No no I never touch Macs either .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .

Why did the group decide to choose the aspect of the shape of the remote to change?|Instead of changing the shape of the remote, the group first discussed changing the batteries because some group mates gave a point under three. However, Marketing thought batteries were easy to insert so it would not be a problem anymore. In addition, all the group members gave the shape of the remote only two points. And they needed to change the most critical one. The shape and the squishiness of the remote were an innovation in terms of technology. Therefore, they all agreed to change the shape.|"[""Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda .

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}
User Interface: You could change the vegetable , or fruit .
Industrial Designer: yeah , I can change the vegetable .
Project Manager: Oh is that broccoli ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .
Project Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: Or like {disfmarker} I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think {disfmarker} see as like {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: like you could {disfmarker} if it was only this {disfmarker} you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .
Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: So like maybe that's just too big
Project Manager: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,
User Interface: because {disfmarker}
Project Manager: which is a nice kind of {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: yeah . But {disfmarker}
User Interface: {gap} I dunno .
Project Manager: I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?
User Interface: I guess {disfmarker}
Project Manager: 'Cause like kind of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .
Project Manager: Yeah , yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Or like even {disfmarker}
User Interface: Dif
Industrial Designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .
Project Manager: Or even like {disfmarker} Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do {disfmarker} I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .
Project Manager: 'Cause that , I think {disfmarker} I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .
Project Manager: And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: And you could {disfmarker} like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Alright .
Project Manager: But I mean it {disfmarker} do we have any other ideas about that ?
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: We could tr I don't know .
Marketing: Think the critical ones came out to be {disfmarker} yeah that one . {vocalsound} . Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: which can be easily {disfmarker} I think that's not a problem any more .
Project Manager: The batteries are going in the back ?
Industrial Designer: That {disfmarker} everyone gave that a one or a two . Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one {disfmarker} I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,
Project Manager: no you could {disfmarker} Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: yeah um like on a normal remote .
Project Manager: Right .
Industrial Designer: So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: I think everyone's under three anyway .
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: So I think it's {disfmarker} yeah those are the only two points .
User Interface: Cool . Well {disfmarker} Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . {vocalsound}


Question: Why did the group decide to choose the aspect of the shape of the remote to change?

What did the group think of the leadership in the process of the project?|Project Manager thought his leadership was crap personally and he never did a management position. While Industrial Designer thought Project Manager did tell them when to start and when to end, which was important in good leadership. And User Interface thought Project Manager did a good job in leadership because they didn't have set roles so much, which was a democratic process. Marketing supplemented that everyone got blended quite well.|"[""Project Manager: 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see .

Industrial Designer: It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .
User Interface: but you could do like {disfmarker} Yeah that's true .
Project Manager: Yeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .

What did the group think of the convenience of presentation materials?|Both User Interface and Industrial Designer thought it was not helpful to use PowerPoint to present. Instead, they preferred writing notes for massive information, while Marketing and Project Manager thought PowerPoint materials were quite useful.

Marketing: Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um
Project Manager: System . Yeah .
Marketing: a whole system ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah I mean , it {gap}
Industrial Designer: Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah , huh .
Industrial Designer: It seems planned you know .
Project Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah I kinda thought that um {disfmarker} I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: because {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like {disfmarker} we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .

Summarize the discussion about product appearance.|The user interface designer put forward that the basic colour would be red and yellow and there would be two basic shapes - circle and triangle, which was called a mushroom design. Specifically, the prototype had 3 key features - a fuzzy look, a spherical channel selection and a stable triangle base. However, the marketing thought mushroom was not in the trends so the group decided to change it into a pineapple.|"['Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}', 'Project Manager: {vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker}', 'User Interface: I have slides .', 'Project Manager: You have s oh , sorry .', 'Industrial Designer: Okay .', 'Project Manager: Oops .', 'User Interface: Ah ,', 'Industrial Designer: Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .', 'User Interface: Product prod', 'Marketing: What slides ?', 'User Interface: Yep .

Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker}
User Interface: I have slides .
Project Manager: You have s oh , sorry .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Oops .
User Interface: Ah ,
Industrial Designer: Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .
User Interface: Product prod
Marketing: What slides ?
User Interface: Yep . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay .
Project Manager: Looks strange . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour ,
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: It's {disfmarker} we call it a mushroom design .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: So this is a introduction of our product .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but
User Interface: Next a mo
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {disfmarker} keep on speaking .
User Interface: yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I'm sure {vocalsound} . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe , I hope so . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be {vocalsound} yellow lemon .
User Interface: Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It's flat , uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah yeah it's flat ,
Project Manager: Squared ?
User Interface: yeah the shape is very boring .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah .
User Interface: Could we come up with new T_V_ with {disfmarker} such as this kind of T_V_ ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: So you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's {disfmarker} that would be really interesting , actually .
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Because the T_V_ you {vocalsound} also {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Device devi
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: The fruit ? {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: Maybe {disfmarker}
Marketing: 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh .
Project Manager: Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Maybe two years it's dead .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm .
Marketing: Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . That's a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .
Marketing: If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for
Industrial Designer: We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .
Marketing: fifteen years {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Customable T_V_ .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: Ah such {disfmarker} yeah . You've already said mobile phones .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Tha that would that would make it . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , you can keep the global appearan
Project Manager: Yeah , and following {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The mood of persons , the fashions uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr
Industrial Designer: We int {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So what i and do w is it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Okay .
Project Manager: So I think the costs are within the budget . We're just at twelve fifty Euros .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , the pr {gap} at {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yep .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: So
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}

Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I'm sure {vocalsound} . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe , I hope so . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design .
Industrial Designer: Because uh it seems that this can be {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , if {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Or it would be better .
Industrial Designer: yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine .
User Interface: Plastic is free . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So , do we need special colour ?
Marketing: Yeah , that's one of the requirement .
Project Manager: Because we have red .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , red and yellow .
Project Manager: Red and yellow .
User Interface: Wait .
Industrial Designer: Fancy .
User Interface: We we can we can we c {vocalsound}
Marketing: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black .
User Interface: yellow .
Marketing: Black then is a regular colour , so .
Project Manager: I think so we need {disfmarker} if we try to have a kind of
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: Yeah , one .
Project Manager: pineapple bee . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah . So push button then it's it's the next expensive one .
Project Manager: Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Integrated scroll wheel push button
Marketing: Yeah , thi this might be .
Project Manager: . So we'll {disfmarker} we have only one ? And push button .
Marketing: Close to .
Project Manager: So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: One . I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing: Okay , so what's the bottleneck ?
User Interface: How about we change the sale ?
Marketing: Double curved .
Industrial Designer: Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah .
Project Manager: Something flat .
Industrial Designer: F some {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , but flat {disfmarker}
Project Manager: S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Single curve {gap} .
Marketing: Case , what's the ca
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I I think I like {vocalsound} the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But don't put sugar in it , it's not working .
User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} No , the colours are uh {disfmarker} it's perfect , yeah .
Industrial Designer: It's perfect , and {disfmarker}
Marketing: True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still .
Industrial Designer: I p is th y {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more {disfmarker} is most important ,
Industrial Designer: the the yellow ball thing that {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control .
Marketing: Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's {disfmarker} yeah but it {disfmarker} I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .
Industrial Designer: Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics ,
User Interface: So we have to give a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: so we have the slogan too .
User Interface: So we have give him {disfmarker} give it a cute name .
Project Manager: Yeah
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: th no , it's the it's the pineapple control {disfmarker} remote control .
User Interface: Mush mushroom controller .
Marketing: Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend .

Meeting Transcript:
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker}
User Interface: I have slides .
Project Manager: You have s oh , sorry .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Oops .
User Interface: Ah ,
Industrial Designer: Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .
User Interface: Product prod
Marketing: What slides ?
User Interface: Yep . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay .
Project Manager: Looks strange . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour ,
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: It's {disfmarker} we call it a mushroom design .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: So this is a introduction of our product .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but
User Interface: Next a mo
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {disfmarker} keep on speaking .
User Interface: yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I'm sure {vocalsound} . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe , I hope so . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design .
Industrial Designer: I think you have nice colours . {vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: But is it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The sha the bowl shape people like .
User Interface: Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Is it really fancy ?
User Interface: {vocalsound} So it depend on how d do you define fancy .
Marketing: Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But it's {disfmarker} you have the lemon aspect of this th this {vocalsound} this thing . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe if you change {disfmarker} if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Do Don't do that , please .
Marketing: I dunno where the lemon is , but
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I mean it's not obvious .
Project Manager: It would be bet more like a lemon ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: If {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Because i
Marketing: I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Less button .
User Interface: Uh so , my mush {disfmarker} .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but you don't have any button now .
User Interface: Mm .
Marketing: Yeah . I dunno .
Project Manager: And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: That's uh yeah , is that {disfmarker}
User Interface: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: that's a good idea .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be {vocalsound} yellow lemon .
User Interface: Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It's flat , uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah yeah it's flat ,
Project Manager: Squared ?
User Interface: yeah the shape is very boring .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah .
User Interface: Could we come up with new T_V_ with {disfmarker} such as this kind of T_V_ ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: So you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's {disfmarker} that would be really interesting , actually .
User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Because the T_V_ you {vocalsound} also {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Device devi
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: The fruit ? {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: Maybe {disfmarker}
Marketing: 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh .
Project Manager: Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Maybe two years it's dead .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm .
Marketing: Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .

Summarize the discussion about product evaluation.|The marketing suggested measuring how good the design was instead of just talking about it so the group started to judge the design in three aspects on a scale of one to seven, one being true and seven being false. The criterion was how fancy, technologically innovative, and easy-to-use the remote control was and it got three, two, and four in separate aspects, which meant it was acceptable.|"['Industrial Designer: Yeah , b I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker}', 'Project Manager: But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple .', 'Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .', 'User Interface: Yeah .', 'Project Manager: If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . {vocalsound}', 'User Interface: Yeah .', 'Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}', 'User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .', 'Project Manager: {vocalsound} So uh mm mm .

Industrial Designer: so mushroom was a kind of you know {gap} uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing: I don't think it is .
Project Manager: It's vegetable .
Industrial Designer: Mushroom ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Oh , uh I'm not sure . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So th it's something eatable .
Industrial Designer: We can {disfmarker} it's a veg a kind of vegetable ,
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: but you know we we integrated them with different colour .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine .
User Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable {gap} you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know .
Marketing: No , I mean , yeah {vocalsound} yeah . Inspira inspiration is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And inspired colour
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and {vocalsound} and very sophisticated material , so .
Marketing: True .
Industrial Designer: And so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Next slide .
User Interface: Uh , no this our only two slides . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {gap}
Industrial Designer: So what we w what I can add is that , you know {vocalsound} he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: it is a low level chip , and {disfmarker}
User Interface: So we cut it to see . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You know , we don't need to k {vocalsound} .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: You know wi {vocalsound} the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i
User Interface: Okay . So where's the battery battery ?
Industrial Designer: The battery it is under {gap} .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Right . So , from one to seven ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I will give {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh {disfmarker} Seven is the ma the maximum ?
Industrial Designer: I'll gi
Marketing: No , seven is false and one is true .
Industrial Designer: I'll give two or three .
Project Manager: Three , I will say three .
Industrial Designer: Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me .
Marketing: Three ?
User Interface: 'Kay
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Isn't it bitter like that {gap} ?
Marketing: Three .
User Interface: Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Then {vocalsound} uh let me {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: What other {disfmarker}
Marketing: The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .
Industrial Designer: Is it easy to use ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Feasible ? {vocalsound} You said previously that you {disfmarker} there's um microphone inside an
Industrial Designer: Ye uh {disfmarker} Embedded .
User Interface: Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact .
Industrial Designer: It's a micro array , okay .
User Interface: There four microphone .
Project Manager: Oh . Okay ,
User Interface: So they they they they {disfmarker} there's a microphone array .
Project Manager: and you have the {disfmarker} there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?
User Interface: Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?
User Interface: So you can capture voice {disfmarker} yeah , you c
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah , yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And I think you {disfmarker} you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is {disfmarker} I
Marketing: Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} W Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: We have tactile buttons .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal .
Industrial Designer: It's fine . It's under or equal . It's fine , so {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay . Okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay . So let's say {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Twelve fifty .
User Interface: Wha what {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It's fine , twelve fifty uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: yeah . Which part is the most expensive part ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Solar cells .
Project Manager: Yeah , I think .
Industrial Designer: The solar cells , r is i is it ?
User Interface: Yeah , I think it's not t t
Project Manager: I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , to be able to si to sell it .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Cheaper .
Marketing: That's nice argument ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , with mi
Marketing: but if it's it's still four our of twelve .
Industrial Designer: It's {disfmarker} it is really really uh really very very expensive , though .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Maybe if uh {disfmarker} okay .
Project Manager: Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .
Marketing: Yeah but we just have one button . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button .
Marketing: Easy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah .
Project Manager: Easy , powerful .
Industrial Designer: It's easy to use . It's very easy to use . {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product .
Industrial Designer: No .

Why did the marketing and the industrial designer disagree with the user interface designer when judging whether the controller was easy to use?|The user interface designer thought it was easier than a traditional controller because you didn't have to press a button, just turn the ball to a certain angle to select channels.

User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: So
Marketing: So , which number ?
Project Manager: {disfmarker} three .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Do you agree ?
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Three ?
User Interface: Yeah , agree , agree .
Marketing: So reasonably , is four , is one ?
Industrial Designer: Three f three for me , it's o it's okay .
Marketing: So , three .
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and {disfmarker} no and just take the mean .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And what's your opinion ?
Industrial Designer: Will you give four ?
Marketing: Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .
Industrial Designer: Five ? Yeah , so maybe if {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh w w what do y what uh {disfmarker} you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ?
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have {disfmarker} you just turn the turn the ball .
Industrial Designer: Yeah but y you know {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface: There's two kind of balls ,
Marketing: So you have {disfmarker}
User Interface: the smaller the the the {disfmarker} so you can c you can c you can control the scale .
Marketing: {vocalsound} yeah .
User Interface: But in the traditional controller , how do {disfmarker} how can you control the scale ?
Marketing: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one .
Industrial Designer: You just push two button , zero and and one .
User Interface: Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .
Project Manager: Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control .
Industrial Designer: my God .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} So th this is a d next generation controller . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Nobody would take it . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Sure . {vocalsound} Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .
Project Manager: So nobody w will lost {disfmarker} lose it .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} yeah maybe , maybe may
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: it's the next prototype , maybe we cou
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay okay , okay .
Project Manager: S maybe we can change from th
Industrial Designer: Four . Maybe four , it's okay .
User Interface: Four . Okay .
Project Manager: Four ? Easy to use , four .
Industrial Designer: I'll put four .
Project Manager: Gonna say four .
Marketing: Four .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , four it's more reasonable .
Marketing: Uh it's even easier to {disfmarker} maybe .
Industrial Designer: You can you can erase with this er yeah .
Marketing: Ok
User Interface: Okay .

Marketing: target .
Industrial Designer: Might {disfmarker} it might be fine .
Project Manager: So , th the project is accepted ?
Marketing: Okay .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I I think I like {vocalsound} the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But don't put sugar in it , it's not working .
User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} No , the colours are uh {disfmarker} it's perfect , yeah .
Industrial Designer: It's perfect , and {disfmarker}

Industrial Designer: I p is th y {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more {disfmarker} is most important ,
Industrial Designer: the the yellow ball thing that {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control .
Marketing: Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's {disfmarker} yeah but it {disfmarker} I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .
Industrial Designer: Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics ,

Summarize the discussion about industrial design and quotation.|The group decided that the product would have a low level chip, one button with LCD, a scroll wheel with a push button on it, a battery in the base, a single curve, and solar cells and it would be plastic instead of wooden so that the costs were 12.5 Euros which was within the budget. Furthermore, they came up with some new ideas about future products, such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable TV that followed the trend and people's moods.|"['Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}', 'Project Manager: {vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker}', 'User Interface: I have slides .', 'Project Manager: You have s oh , sorry .', 'Industrial Designer: Okay .', 'Project Manager: Oops .', 'User Interface: Ah ,', 'Industrial Designer: Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .', 'User Interface: Product prod', 'Marketing: What slides ?', 'User Interface: Yep .

Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker}
User Interface: I have slides .
Project Manager: You have s oh , sorry .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Oops .
User Interface: Ah ,
Industrial Designer: Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .
User Interface: Product prod
Marketing: What slides ?
User Interface: Yep . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay .
Project Manager: Looks strange . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour ,
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: It's {disfmarker} we call it a mushroom design .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: So this is a introduction of our product .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but
User Interface: Next a mo
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {disfmarker} keep on speaking .
User Interface: yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I'm sure {vocalsound} . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe , I hope so . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design .
Industrial Designer: We've done it with {disfmarker} it is under the {disfmarker} if it was low , high or so .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Um okay .
Project Manager: Now {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker} So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ?
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well I think we have just have to discuss if {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay , okay , it's fine .
Marketing: I dunno .
Project Manager: So did you enjoy your clay modelling ?
User Interface: Yes . Of course . This is my job . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah ? {vocalsound} Was it a nice way to create your remote control ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah , it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to {disfmarker} from the beginning to the end . And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very {vocalsound} informative for {gap} .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: And for the marketing guy ?
Marketing: Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe .
Industrial Designer: Yep {vocalsound} .
Marketing: 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it {disfmarker} um .
Industrial Designer: Okay , okay .
Project Manager: And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yellow . {vocalsound} I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a fruit T_V_ or I dunno .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It can be an interesting I don't know {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah but I think f {vocalsound} it's really a celebrating object . {vocalsound} So it's yellow and very {disfmarker} a very ha it's very happy , so .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: Uh it's it's a pr it's like {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . It's party party remote control .
Project Manager: The thing now is to to sell it .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah , it's your job . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Sell it . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: right , go and sell it . Goo and good luck , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . Okay and the twelve fifty {disfmarker} twelve uh twelve {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh-huh . Twenty five Euros .
User Interface: Twenty five Euros , yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} It should be fine .
Marketing: Yeah , I think it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's maybe a little bit expensive . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Twenty five Euros .
Marketing: It's cheap , yeah . {vocalsound} No , I {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} No , it's not so expensive .
Marketing: I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Wh really ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . {vocalsound} S
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , {vocalsound} it's really fruit . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah .

Industrial Designer: It is in th in {disfmarker} in the base , yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: In the basement . In the basement .
User Interface: Base . Here ?
Project Manager: And where is the solar solar cell ?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: But we say uh we sa we said solar .
Project Manager: Where is the solar cell ?
Industrial Designer: In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh . Do you think it won't be {disfmarker} It won't cris increase the price ?
User Interface: Okay
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} I don't think so ,
Project Manager: Okay , we'll see after .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} but it it's might be okay , so .
Project Manager: We will have first to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I it might be okay . So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about {disfmarker} uh
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: we had three keys {disfmarker} {vocalsound} key points to uh for this remote control design ,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: and first one was uh
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: fancy look and feel .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh just let me check .
Industrial Designer: So , four point {disfmarker} three point five , it means it's acceptable .
Marketing: One one being true , and seven being false . Okay .
Industrial Designer: Oops .
Marketing: Ouch . So
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , b I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So uh mm mm . Mm .
Industrial Designer: That's the finance .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm . Okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So we need to calculate the production cost . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: And if not {disfmarker} if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: So , just have a look at the {disfmarker} okay here is the Excel sheet , so
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that .
Marketing: No .
Project Manager: We have battery , right ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , we have battery .
Project Manager: Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose ,
Industrial Designer: No ,

Industrial Designer: um solar cells , yeah .
Project Manager: Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or {disfmarker} such as {vocalsound} as number of branches ?
Industrial Designer: Uh I think in each ball you have three {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Three ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal .

Industrial Designer: It's fine , twelve fifty uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: yeah . Which part is the most expensive part ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Solar cells .
Project Manager: Yeah , I think .
Industrial Designer: The solar cells , r is i is it ?
User Interface: Yeah , I think it's not t t
Project Manager: I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , to be able to si to sell it .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Cheaper .
Marketing: That's nice argument ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , with mi
Marketing: but if it's it's still four our of twelve .
Industrial Designer: It's {disfmarker} it is really really uh really very very expensive , though .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Maybe if uh {disfmarker} okay .

Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .
Marketing: Yeah but we just have one button . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}

Summarize the discussion about remote control style.|Marketing revealed that the younger target group preferred colourful objects and soft material. Project Manager agreed and added that the remote control should be light and not too slippery. Then Industrial Designer introduced three casing possibilities: uncurved, single-curved and double-curved. Considering that uncurved design could be too dull and double-curved design would make it difficult to use scroll-wheels, the team chose the single-curved design.|"['Project Manager: Yeah .', 'Marketing: Yeah .', ""Project Manager: And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control ."", 'Industrial Designer: Yes .', ""Project Manager: Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,"", 'Industrial Designer: Slippery .', 'Project Manager: s because um {disfmarker}', ""User Interface: But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber ."", 'Industrial Designer: You have to grab it .', 'Project Manager: Yeah .

Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control .
Industrial Designer: Yes .
Project Manager: Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,
Industrial Designer: Slippery .
Project Manager: s because um {disfmarker}
User Interface: But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .
Industrial Designer: You have to grab it .
Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah , exactly .
User Interface: So it's easy in your hand {disfmarker} Uh indeed .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,
Project Manager: Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier .
Project Manager: Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So m Yes .
Project Manager: okay .
Industrial Designer: But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .
Project Manager: Okay , good .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Great . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .
Project Manager: Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: yeah .
User Interface: So if you have the voice recognition , you can {vocalsound} you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay , b but I think we'll {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,
Industrial Designer: because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . {vocalsound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .
User Interface: Yeah . Right .
Industrial Designer: But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium .

Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You really have to imagine like {vocalsound} winding up your {disfmarker} uh
User Interface: {vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well , it would be very new to the market ,
Industrial Designer: But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . {gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a {disfmarker} in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,
Project Manager: Yeah . And wha
Industrial Designer: well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So , but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .
Project Manager: Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .
Industrial Designer: Uh yes , it does .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: I'll come to that later .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . {vocalsound} The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it .

Why did the team choose single-curved design when discussing remote control style?|Industrial Designer introduced uncurved, single-curved and double-curved design at first. User Interface and Project Manager thought that uncurved design was too dull and Industrial Designer pointed out that double-curved design would make it impossible to use scroll-wheels, so the team selected single-curved design eventually.|"[""Industrial Designer: because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities .

Meeting Transcript:
Industrial Designer: because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . {vocalsound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .
User Interface: Yeah . Right .
Industrial Designer: But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . {vocalsound} Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh {vocalsound} remote controls .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You really have to imagine like {vocalsound} winding up your {disfmarker} uh
User Interface: {vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well , it would be very new to the market ,
Industrial Designer: Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: There's {disfmarker} there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation . {vocalsound} About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah , you can um {disfmarker} I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word {disfmarker} you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function
Industrial Designer: okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yeah .
User Interface: and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: and then it's um {disfmarker} well , I believe it's uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: It performs the action . Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what {disfmarker} which he believes it is .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Project Manager: Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: {vocalsound} The project drawing is for the next {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , it's it's uh {disfmarker} when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .
User Interface: Yeah , right .
Industrial Designer: Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?
Project Manager: Yeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down .
Industrial Designer: I'll do .
Project Manager: Great . Um {disfmarker} Uh you you need to help me . Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay . W start with the casing .
Project Manager: The casing is curved , single-curved .
User Interface: Single-curved .
Industrial Designer: Okay , single-curved case . Okay . What about the energy source ?
Project Manager: Traditional batteries uh and solar .
User Interface: But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ?
Project Manager: No ,
User Interface: 'Cause if we have to choose {disfmarker}
Project Manager: they can be complementary . Uh al al I uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: yeah ?
Industrial Designer: I I think they can . Yes .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Well , uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Every device {disfmarker}
User Interface: What if not ?
Industrial Designer: It it should be . There should be really no problem .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: They can be supplementary . That's no problem .
Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , um
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: th
Industrial Designer: So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar .
Project Manager: Battery and solar , yeah .
Industrial Designer: Okay . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?
Project Manager: Yeah , with colourful rubber .

User Interface: Mm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yes . That is possible too . Yes .
User Interface: {gap} {disfmarker} But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels {disfmarker} I had some {disfmarker} I had some information about it too .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: I don't think {vocalsound} there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .
Industrial Designer: Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .
Project Manager: This will be the remote , right ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?
User Interface: Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,
Industrial Designer: Uh it's do it's done before .
Project Manager: Because this is how you keep it {disfmarker}
User Interface: but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .
User Interface: But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Volume ?
Industrial Designer: Well , it's it {disfmarker} well , i what he means is there's an {disfmarker} button integrated in the scroll-wheel .
User Interface: A volume , okay .
Industrial Designer: There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .
Project Manager: Well , what about mute ?
Industrial Designer: About mute .
Project Manager: Thi i i m I guess uh th
Industrial Designer: Well , yes .
Project Manager: this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .
Project Manager: And click it to muten the device .
Industrial Designer: Well , okay . It's quite goods .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yes .
Project Manager: So maybe um {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} that's something you two uh need to think about .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .
Marketing: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well ,
User Interface: Wheel .
Marketing: it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Hmm . {vocalsound} But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker} Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .
Project Manager: Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .
Industrial Designer: So maybe it's not no {gap} .
Project Manager: Nokia has a {disfmarker} well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .
Industrial Designer: Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .
Project Manager: Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: It doesn't use a {disfmarker} {gap} . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: For you too , yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .
Industrial Designer: Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .

Why did the team decide not to use LCD displays when discussing interface controls?|Industrial Manager revealed that if LCD was used, they had to choose advanced chips. Project Manager thought it was within the budget and LCD displays could add extra high-tech feeling. User Interface then pointed out that they already had too many high-tech substances including scroll-wheels, voice recognition and a fancy look so they didn't need to use LCD displays.|"[""Industrial Designer: But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . {gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it .

Industrial Designer: But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . {gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a {disfmarker} in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,
Project Manager: Yeah . And wha
Industrial Designer: well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So , but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .
Project Manager: Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .
Industrial Designer: Uh yes , it does .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: I'll come to that later .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . {vocalsound} The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels .

What was said about EML talk?|The talk will present the work that is currently being done at ICSI including examples of inference of user intentions and of the recordings of the on-going data collection.

Grad A: OK .
Grad D: OK .
Grad C: That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea .
Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK .
Grad C: OK ? Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here and so of course , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm gonna start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning {disfmarker} The Cave Forty - Five is a {disfmarker} is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that {disfmarker} that time . And so
Grad F: OK .
Grad C: they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? Uh , which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , or in the Bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . And so forth . So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine {disfmarker} nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . Um , {vocalsound} and so forth and so forth . That 's sort of motivating it . Then what have we done so far ? We had our little bit of , um , um , SmartKom stuff , that we did , um , everth
Grad F: Oh , you 've got the parser done . Sorry .
Grad C: That 's the {disfmarker} not the construction parser . That 's the , uh , tablet - based parser ,
Grad F: OK .
Grad A: Easy parser .
Grad F: OK .
Grad C: and the generation outputter .
Grad D: Halfway done ? Yeah .
Grad C: That 's done .
Grad A: Mmm .
Grad C: You have to change those strategies ,
Grad D: OK .
Grad C: right ? That 's , ten words ?
Grad C: OK . And so forth and so forth . Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , um , I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz , but I thought it would interesting to , uh , um , point out that it 's basically the same .

Grad A: Yes .
Grad C: I mean I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig , so .
Grad A: It 's {disfmarker} it 's certainly related , um ,
Grad C: Because , um , EML is building up a huge thing in Leipzig .
Grad A: might wanna say . Is it ?
Grad C: So it {disfmarker} It 's on biocomputation . Would {disfmarker}
Professor E: Yeah , it 's different , this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building .
Grad C: Yeah .
Professor E: Yeah .
Grad A: Kind of a different level of analysis .
Professor E: The {disfmarker} yeah it was {disfmarker} it turns out that if {disfmarker} if you have multiple billions of dollars , y you can do all sorts of weird things , and {disfmarker}
Grad D: Wait , they 're building a building in the shape of DNA ,
Grad A: What ?
Grad D: is that what you said ?
Professor E: Roughly , yeah .
Grad F: Oh ! Oh boy !
Grad A: O
Professor E: Including cr cross - bridges ,
Grad A: What ?
Professor E: and
Grad A: Oh my god !
Grad F: That 's brilliant ! Hhh .
Professor E: You d you really {disfmarker} now I I spent {disfmarker} the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story which is , um {disfmarker}
Grad A: Of what
Grad D: Y You definitely wanna w don't wanna waste that money on research ,
Grad A: the building ?
Grad D: you know ?
Professor E: Right .
Grad D: That 's horrible .
Professor E: Right . Well , no , no , y i there 's infinite money . See you th you th you then fill it with researchers .

What was said about the talk and neurons?|As the talk at EML will also refer to a theoretical framework, it was suggested that along with presenting NTL and the piece on mirror neurons, it also alludes to relevant fMRI work. The neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups. The language analysis itself will be introduced in terms of image schemas. On the other hand, it was arranged for more feedback on the thesis proposal to be sent by email. The latest version of the construction formalism will also be needed to complete the presentation.|"['Grad A: Before the twenty - ninth ,', 'Grad C: The twenty - ninth .', 'Grad A: OK .', 'Grad D: OK .', ""Grad C: That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea ."", 'Grad A: Mm - hmm .

Professor B: It 's {disfmarker} it 's um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But we did {disfmarker} Oh yeah , the other thing I was asking him , though , is that I think that in the case {disfmarker} Yeah , you {disfmarker} you do have to be careful because of com compounded results . I think we got some earlier results {pause} in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you didn't have {pause} three , but you just had one {pause} language .

Where you , {pause} say , trained on Spanish and tested on {disfmarker} on TI - digits , or the other way around ? Something like that ?
PhD E: No .
Professor B: I thought there was something like that , {pause} that he showed me {pause} last week . We 'll have to wait till we get {disfmarker}
PhD A: Yeah , that would be interesting .
Professor B: Um , This may have been what I was asking before , Stephane , but {disfmarker} {pause} but , um , wasn't there something that you did , {pause} where you trained {pause} on one language and tested on another ? I mean no {disfmarker} no mixture but just {disfmarker}
Grad F: I 'll get it for you .
PhD D: Uh , no , no .
Professor B: We 've never just trained on one lang
PhD D: Training on a single language , you mean , and testing on the other one ?
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD D: Uh , no .
PhD E: Not yet .
PhD D: So the only {pause} task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages , and {comment} that {disfmarker}
PhD D: Uh , No . Either thi this is test with {pause} uh the same language {pause} but from the broad data , or it 's test with {pause} uh different languages also from the broad data , excluding the {disfmarker} So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's three or {disfmarker} three and four .
PhD E: The early experiment that {disfmarker}
PhD A: Did you do different languages from digits ?
PhD D: Uh . No . You mean {pause} training digits {pause} on one language and using the net {pause} to recognize on the other ?
PhD A: Digits on another language ?
PhD D: No .
Professor B: See , I thought you showed me something like that last week . You had a {disfmarker} you had a little {disfmarker}
PhD D: Uh , {pause} No , I don't think so .
Professor B: Um What {disfmarker}
PhD C: These numbers are uh {pause} ratio to baseline ?
Professor B: So , I mean wha what 's the {disfmarker}
PhD D: So .
Professor B: This {disfmarker} this chart {disfmarker} this table that we 're looking at {pause} is um , show is all testing for TI - digits , or {disfmarker} ?
Grad F: Bigger is worse .
PhD D: So you have uh basically two {pause} uh parts .
Grad F: This is error rate , I think .
PhD C: Ratio .
Grad F: No . {pause} No .
PhD D: The upper part is for TI - digits
Grad F: Yeah , yeah , yeah .
PhD D: and it 's divided in three {pause} rows {pause} of four {disfmarker} four rows each .
Grad F: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD D: And the first four rows is well - matched , then the s the second group of four rows is mismatched , and {pause} finally highly mismatched . And then the lower part is for Italian and it 's the same {disfmarker} {pause} the same thing .
Professor B: Uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um now , what 's the noise condition {pause} um {pause} of the training data {disfmarker}
PhD D: Still poor .
Professor B: Well , I think this is what you were explaining . The noise condition is the same {disfmarker} It 's the same uh Aurora noises uh , in all these cases {pause} for the training .
PhD D: Yeah . Yeah .
Professor B: So there 's not a {pause} statistical {disfmarker} sta a strong st {pause} statistically different {pause} noise characteristic between {pause} uh the training and test
PhD D: No these are the s s s same noises ,
Professor B: and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect {disfmarker}
PhD D: yeah . At least {disfmarker} at least for the first {disfmarker} {pause} for the well - matched ,
Grad F: Well matched condition .
Professor B: Right .
PhD D: yeah .
Professor B: So there 's some kind of a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} an effect from having these {disfmarker} uh this broader coverage um Now I guess what we should try doing with this is try {pause} testing these on u this same sort of thing on {disfmarker} you probably must have this {pause} lined up to do . To try the same t {pause} with the exact same training , do testing on {pause} the other languages .
PhD D: Mmm .
Professor B: On {disfmarker} on um {disfmarker} So . Um , oh I well , wait a minute . You have this here , for the Italian . That 's right . OK , so , {pause} So .
PhD D: Yeah . Yeah , so for the Italian the results are {vocalsound} uh {pause} stranger um {pause} Mmm . So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is {pause} not very close to Italian because uh , well , {pause} when using the {disfmarker} the network trained only on Spanish it 's {disfmarker} {pause} the error rate is {pause} almost uh twice {pause} the baseline error rate .
Professor B: Mm - hmm .

PhD D: So this is not so bad . And then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's uh it become worse and , well Around uh , let 's say , {pause} twenty perc twenty percent further .
Professor B: Ab - about how much ?
PhD D: So . Yeah .
Professor B: Twenty percent further ?
PhD D: Twenty to {disfmarker} to thirty percent further . Yeah .
PhD A: And so , remind me , the multilingual stuff is just the broad data . Right ? It 's not the digits .
PhD D: Yeah .
PhD A: So it 's the combination of {pause} two things there . It 's {pause} removing the {pause} task specific {pause} training and {pause} it 's adding other languages .
PhD D: Yeah . Yeah .
PhD A: OK .
PhD D: But the first step is al already removing the task s specific from {disfmarker} from {disfmarker}
PhD A: Already , right right right .
PhD D: So .
PhD A: So they were sort of building {pause} here ?
PhD D: And we lose {disfmarker}
PhD A: OK ?
PhD D: Yeah . Uh {pause} So , basically when it 's trained on the {disfmarker} the multilingual broad data {pause} um or number {disfmarker} so , the {disfmarker} the {pause} ratio of our error rates uh with the {pause} baseline error rate is around {pause} uh one point one .
Professor B: Yes . {vocalsound} And it 's something like one point three of {disfmarker} of the {pause} uh {disfmarker}
PhD D: So .
Professor B: I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline , you get something like one point one for the {disfmarker} for the using the same language but a different task , and something like one point three {pause} for three {disfmarker} three languages {pause} broad stuff .
Professor B: you {pause} do {pause} go to {pause} three languages including the English , {pause} it 's something like one point three . That 's what you were just saying , I think .
PhD D: Ye Uh , more actually .
PhD A: One point four ?
PhD D: If I {disfmarker} Yeah .
PhD A: So , it 's an additional thirty percent .
PhD D: What would you say ? Around one point four
Professor B: OK .
PhD D: yeah .
Professor B: And if you exclude {pause} English , {pause} from this combination , what 's that ?
PhD D: If we exclude English , {pause} um {pause} there is {pause} not much difference with the {pause} data with English .
Professor B: Aha !
PhD D: So . Yeah .
Professor B: That 's interesting . {pause} That 's interesting . Do you see ? Because {disfmarker} Uh ,
PhD D: Uh .
Professor B: so {disfmarker} No , that {disfmarker} that 's important . So what {disfmarker} what it 's saying here is just that "" yes , there is a reduction {pause} in performance , {pause} when you don't {pause} um {pause} have the s {pause} when you don't have {pause} um
PhD A: Task data .
Professor B: Wait a minute , th th the {disfmarker}
PhD D: Hmm .
Professor B: No , actually {pause} it 's interesting . So it 's {disfmarker} So when you go to a different task , there 's actually not so {pause} different . It 's when you went to these {disfmarker} So what 's the difference between two and three ? Between the one point one case and the one point four case ? I 'm confused .
PhD A: It 's multilingual .
PhD D: Yeah . The only difference it 's {disfmarker} is that it 's multilingual {disfmarker} Um
Professor B: Cuz in both {disfmarker} in both {disfmarker} both of those cases , you don't have the same task .
PhD D: To TIMIT . Mmm . Then you have {pause} uh MF , {pause} MS and ME which are for French , Spanish and English . And , yeah . Actually I {disfmarker} {pause} I uh forgot to say that {pause} the multilingual net are trained {pause} on {pause} uh {pause} features without the s derivatives uh but with {pause} increased frame numbers .

PhD A: Multi - French , Multi - Spanish

Professor B: Uh OK . So , it 's {pause} uh {pause} broader vocabulary . Then {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}
PhD D: Yeah .
Professor B: OK so I think what I 'm {disfmarker} what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was {disfmarker} was {pause} there were some numbers I saw , I think , that included these multiple languages and it {disfmarker} and I was seeing {pause} that it got worse .

Summarize the discussion on managing the complexity of the model|The team discussed the size of the neural net, which was just a simple net. At the time, it had 27 outputs, but the professor recommended that they use a larger net, with perhaps more features. They discussed the effect that removing silent frames could have on the model.

PhD D: We {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it 's slightly {pause} uh different because {pause} I don't exactly initialize the same way she does . Actually I start , {pause} mmm , I don't wait to a fifteen {disfmarker} twenty - five {disfmarker} twenty - five frames {pause} before computing a mean and the variance {pause} to e to {disfmarker} to start the recursion .
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD D: I {disfmarker} I use the on - line scheme and only start the re recursion after the twenty - five {disfmarker} {pause} twenty - fifth frame . But , well it 's similar . So {pause} uh I retrained {pause} the networks with {pause} these {disfmarker} well , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the networks are retaining with these new {pause} features .
Professor B: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: And , yeah .
Professor B: OK .
PhD D: So basically what I expect is that {pause} these numbers will a little bit go down but {pause} perhaps not {disfmarker} not so much
Professor B: Right .
PhD D: because {pause} I think the neural networks learn perhaps {pause} to {disfmarker}
Professor B: Right .
Professor B: Well , see they , I {disfmarker} I think they 're Um . I don't know the {disfmarker} {pause} the specifics of how they 're doing it . They 're {disfmarker} {pause} they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to {pause} um , change the scripts {pause} for the recognizer , {pause} I believe .
PhD A: Oh , right . Maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ?
Professor B: So . Uh . Uh , you know that 's what I had thought . But I don't {disfmarker} I don't think they are .
PhD A: Hmm .
Professor B: I mean that 's {disfmarker} sort of what {disfmarker} the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side , yeah you p put some low level noise or something . Probably don't want all zeros .
PhD A: Hmm .
Professor B: Most recognizers don't like zeros but {vocalsound} but {pause} you know , {pause} put some epsilon in or some rand
PhD A: Yeah .
Professor B: sorry epsilon random variable {pause} in or something .
PhD A: Some constant vector . I mean i w Or something {disfmarker}
Professor B: Maybe not a constant but it doesn't , uh {disfmarker} don't like to divide by the variance of that , but I mean it 's
PhD A: That 's right . But something that {disfmarker} what I mean is something that is {pause} very distinguishable from {pause} speech .
Professor B: Mm - hmm .
PhD A: So that the {disfmarker} the silence model in HTK will always pick it up .
Professor B: Yeah . So I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} that 's what I thought they would do . or else , uh {pause} uh maybe there is some indicator to tell it to start and stop , I don't know .
PhD A: Hmm .

Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on funding from Siân Gwenllian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: May I begin, maybe, with a question, generally speaking—? We're all aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general. So, can this lead to more exclusions, because additional learning needs have been hit in light of these challenges, and then that the side-effects of that creates more exclusions?
Sharon Davies: In particular now with the new Act coming into force, that's going to place more pressure on the system. In Torfaen, we know that we have schools that are looking at their funding—they are behind, and they have to make these hard choices. And sometimes, they have to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that does place additional pressure on the schools.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Is the additional learning needs sector being adversely affected, worse than—?
Sharon Davies: I'm not sure whether it's being worse affected, but certainly there's pressure, in particular with the new Act coming in, and that's going to place more pressure on the system.
Sian Gwenllian AM: But maybe we need to spend more in light of the new Act?
Sharon Davies: Yes.
Nick Williams: Yes, certainly.
Sian Hughes: What is your experience, then?

What did David Hopkins think of the new Act?|David Hopkins agreed with Sharon Davies that the new Act would exert more pressure on schools. However, he denied that the levels of the delegation would have any impact. Meanwhile, he suggested that it would be better for the schools' headmasters and local authorities to look at the new Act more constructively, for it would be beneficial for the post-16 sector.|"[""David Hopkins: Yes, sure. The delegation levels are already very high in most authority areas, and we've got agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money, or as much money as possible, is devolved to schools. So, I don't think that's a direct factor. I think the factors that really affect exclusions, which is where I think the question came from: you've got the very narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment, which I think has put pressure on some schools, certainly, and headteachers have felt that—sometimes excluded, or otherwise put into another school as a consequence, which is regrettable, but that's what's happened. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister has currently made some more money available, if we look at experiences that have happened in England, in particular, because there are direct parallels there with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding has become increasingly under pressure—there have been big issues around tribunals, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again. So, there are financial pressures there, but I don't think the levels of delegation have any impact on that."", 'Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. But just the pressures coming in with the new Act et cetera could mean more expulsions.', ""Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands, and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum, of course. What are the challenges? I'll begin with the WLGA, in general, and ask you, in both your areas, what are the challenges to ensure that EOTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum, and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them? What are the challenges associated with that?"", ""David Hopkins: In general terms—. You differentiate there between EOTAS and PRUs. PRUs: clearly, we know that they are following a set curriculum; they are inspected; they are under the control of the local authorities. So, we're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there. Where home tuition is provided through the local authority, as has been discussed, again, there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving. You can't always guarantee what then happens in the home. As you say, particular things happen there, and they may not get that. But that's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle. It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned. The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer.

Meeting Transcript:
David Hopkins: Yes, sure. The delegation levels are already very high in most authority areas, and we've got agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money, or as much money as possible, is devolved to schools. So, I don't think that's a direct factor. I think the factors that really affect exclusions, which is where I think the question came from: you've got the very narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment, which I think has put pressure on some schools, certainly, and headteachers have felt that—sometimes excluded, or otherwise put into another school as a consequence, which is regrettable, but that's what's happened. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister has currently made some more money available, if we look at experiences that have happened in England, in particular, because there are direct parallels there with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding has become increasingly under pressure—there have been big issues around tribunals, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again. So, there are financial pressures there, but I don't think the levels of delegation have any impact on that.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. But just the pressures coming in with the new Act et cetera could mean more expulsions.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands, and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum, of course. What are the challenges? I'll begin with the WLGA, in general, and ask you, in both your areas, what are the challenges to ensure that EOTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum, and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them? What are the challenges associated with that?
David Hopkins: In general terms—. You differentiate there between EOTAS and PRUs. PRUs: clearly, we know that they are following a set curriculum; they are inspected; they are under the control of the local authorities. So, we're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there. Where home tuition is provided through the local authority, as has been discussed, again, there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving. You can't always guarantee what then happens in the home. As you say, particular things happen there, and they may not get that. But that's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle. It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned. The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer. I couldn't give you a definitive one of what's happening across Wales. My colleagues can probably tell you what's happening in their localities, and that would be helpful. But in general: PRUs, yes, we'd be satisfied; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority, yes, we would be satisfied; other areas, we would not be able to give a definitive answer on, is my guess.

What was considered by David Hopkins as the factor that affected exclusions?|David Hopkins did not think that the delegation levels were not high enough in most authority areas. Instead, he thought they had got agreements with the government to make sure that enough money was devolved to school. The true decisive factor was the narrow measure at the end of Stage 4 that drove the headmasters to exclude students or put them into another school.|"[""David Hopkins: Yes, sure.

What did the meeting discuss about the networking within the PRU and the transition arrangements?|There had been improvements in the networking within the PRU, for they had national meetings on a regular basis, which could lead to a better sharing of practice. The PRU was planning to provide teachers with professional training. On the transition arrangement, the PRU was building a brand new provision in Swansea. The PRU would support students through a part-time timetable back into school. Besides, the support would not stop as soon as the students returned to school; the reduction of support would be managed.|"[""Nick Williams: Well, one of the things I think that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector. We meet on a regular basis, and that's nationally. And the EOTAS group meets regionally as well. So, there's definitely a better sharing of practice. We put on some very, very good conferences as one form of professional learning. But it's also important—. And we're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider, or it's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits, joint visits, to provision and also using the expertise that we do have within the sector to work more closely with our schools, and vice versa, particularly around the curriculum. And I think this is the opportunity the new curriculum provides, providing our staff have the funding to do that and the opportunities we need to be creating around that as well. But in the past, there might well have been some staff who perhaps hadn't had those school experiences and vice versa."", ""Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Can I just ask you about transition arrangements, because I know some of the issues that have arisen in my own constituency is when a pupil is in a PRU and then trying to get back into mainstream education? It isn't a clear, sort of, going from one to the other—sometimes a child can find themselves at home because they're not able to get back into the school setting, the main school setting. How are you addressing that?"", ""Nick Williams: Well, again, I can only speak for ourselves. We've had a big investment of time, and there will be money and through band B, we're building a brand-new PRU provision in Swansea, which will be open in January 2021. So, we've recognised that, so that we have our staff working very closely with the schools. There's an integration through a part-time timetable back into school, and we continue to support them during that process.

But they looked at a partnership within the schools, then, to say, 'Okay, you can have the money, but there's got to be terms of reference'—not quite a service level agreement, but the schools worked together as a partnership, then, so that they couldn't keep moving the children around, the learners around. It's looking at how well that worked. It started off really well, but that was a few years ago, so I don't know whether it's continued now.

What was the major challenge of the transition of the excluded students?|The students coming to the end of their statutory education were facing the biggest challenge, for it would be far more difficult for them to go back into the mainstream education process when they turned 15 or 16, not to mention the transition into further education, such as colleges.|"[""Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on funding from Siân Gwenllian."", ""Sian Gwenllian AM: May I begin, maybe, with a question, generally speaking—? We're all aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general. So, can this lead to more exclusions, because additional learning needs have been hit in light of these challenges, and then that the side-effects of that creates more exclusions?"", ""Sharon Davies: In particular now with the new Act coming into force, that's going to place more pressure on the system. In Torfaen, we know that we have schools that are looking at their funding—they are behind, and they have to make these hard choices. And sometimes, they have to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that does place additional pressure on the schools."", 'Sian Gwenllian AM: Is the additional learning needs sector being adversely affected, worse than—?', ""Sharon Davies: I'm not sure whether it's being worse affected, but certainly there's pressure, in particular with the new Act coming in, and that's going to place more pressure on the system."", 'Sian Gwenllian AM: But maybe we need to spend more in light of the new Act?', 'Sharon Davies: Yes.', 'Nick Williams: Yes, certainly.', 'Sian Hughes: What is your experience, then?', ""Nick Williams: The same, really. But just sometimes, the Government doesn't think about the staff in the pupil referral units, because we've gone back to the Government to tell them, 'Right, you've provided money to school staff, but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in the school sector?' And in fairness, they have addressed that, but perhaps it's not at the forefront of their minds when they're thinking of providing funding to the schools. So, it's a little bit of an afterthought.

Meeting Transcript:
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on funding from Siân Gwenllian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: May I begin, maybe, with a question, generally speaking—? We're all aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general. So, can this lead to more exclusions, because additional learning needs have been hit in light of these challenges, and then that the side-effects of that creates more exclusions?
Sharon Davies: In particular now with the new Act coming into force, that's going to place more pressure on the system. In Torfaen, we know that we have schools that are looking at their funding—they are behind, and they have to make these hard choices. And sometimes, they have to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that does place additional pressure on the schools.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Is the additional learning needs sector being adversely affected, worse than—?
Sharon Davies: I'm not sure whether it's being worse affected, but certainly there's pressure, in particular with the new Act coming in, and that's going to place more pressure on the system.
Sian Gwenllian AM: But maybe we need to spend more in light of the new Act?
Sharon Davies: Yes.
Nick Williams: Yes, certainly.
Sian Hughes: What is your experience, then?
Nick Williams: The same, really. But just sometimes, the Government doesn't think about the staff in the pupil referral units, because we've gone back to the Government to tell them, 'Right, you've provided money to school staff, but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in the school sector?' And in fairness, they have addressed that, but perhaps it's not at the forefront of their minds when they're thinking of providing funding to the schools. So, it's a little bit of an afterthought. But this will be needed in the future, certainly.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And is the fact that there's variation from term to term, from week to week sometimes, in the level of provision that a school is going to have to provide for trying to retain those pupils in mainstream schools—is the fact that there is so much variation creating a specific challenge, and maybe that that leads to more exclusions?
Sharon Davies: As you say, because it changes, it's difficult then to plan ahead, and from year to year and also, as you've said, within the term. Perhaps you have provision for more learners coming in or moving, and then that causes the pressure within the system, then, because you haven't planned for them, and therefore there's no spare funding there to draw on.
Nick Williams: Also, in fairness to PRUs, we've been trying to work on the fact that, if children move out of school, the funding follows them.

What was the solution to the major challenge for the transition of the excluded students?|Sharon Davies recommended the team-around-the-family approach to ensure what was needed for learners to go back into school, as well as what the school could provide. She pointed out the importance of the whole package of support, which not only surrounded the learners but also their families. In addition, she gave an example of the PRU in Oxford who built the partnership between the school and the PRU student to demonstrate the responsibility of schools and the significance of school participation.|"[""Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.

What did the meeting discuss about the pros and cons of local authoritative frameworks?|One of the advantages was that youngsters' voice could be heard in time if they showed the willingness to go back into school; the framework offered the excluded learners a cooling-off period. The disadvantage was mainly some individual schools' lack of capacity to organize and offer additional training. Monitor and evaluation systems of the EOTAS provision were supposed to be set up to ensure the education quality.|"['Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. So, to what extent, then, do local authorities have clear strategies for support and reintegration, and a continuum of provision to meet the needs of learners who are either at risk of exclusion, or disengagement?', ""Nick Williams: Well, we've just developed a behaviour and well-being strategy, which, with our schools—and I'm aware, because I work in the south-west and mid Wales region, and I know some of the other local authorities have something similar, and, similarly, I chair the EOTAS network across Wales, and I know many local authorities are going in that direction, so that has a tiered approach, or staged approach, or whichever, so that there's universal provision. I think it's something that—you know, we need to make sure that our staff and our schools are well-equipped to meet these needs, but there will always, unfortunately, be some learners who need more specialist provision. So, it's equipping them with those sorts of skills, really. I think it's certainly moved forward from where we were two of three years ago. But there's a little bit of lag in the system, trying to bring everybody up to the same, consistent level. But I think work is afoot in nearly all local authorities, as far as I'm aware."", 'Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. In terms of school accountability measures, do you think that they have had an impact on the rise in exclusions?', ""Sharon Davies: When we're looking at the accountabilities, there's a huge amount of pressures on schools to perform, and I think the whole culture that the schools are within does play an element of it to some—. There is a shift in that culture. We are seeing a change with the interim measures coming on board, but I think there's going to be a lag in the system before we see that having a knock-on effect on our learners, because, undoubtedly, there are pressures on schools."", ""Lynne Neagle AM: So, you've seen an improvement since the capped 9 has been brought in?"", ""Sharon Davies: I think it's early to say,\xa0but certainly we're working towards that improvement. I can only speak for Torfaen—we've been working really hard on our exclusions and working with our schools to ensure that the curriculum is broad and balanced, and accounts for every learner within the system."", ""Nick Williams: Sorry. Capacity: we just haven't got enough spaces in some cases, some year groups and so on. Obviously, given what I've said as well, and I'm sure it'd be the same for all local authorities, we've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision, if you like, the home school. So, there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable, which isn't ideal, I accept, but again, it's working with the families and the youngsters. Also, for us as well we've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion. We have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners. Sometimes, it works really well; sometimes, the learner turns around and says, 'Actually, I preferred it in my old school.' So, there's a cooling-off period as well. I think the learner voice is very important there, because—. We've got to have a package, I think, that is quite wide in its offer."", 'Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. What would be the advantages or disadvantages, then, of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for providers, and for EOTAS providers to have approved status?', ""Nick Williams: Obviously, we do do that, but we're struggling sometimes for additional provision—very important around safeguarding. However, we don't want to make it too difficult, so that we haven't got any providers coming forward either. So, it's a little bit of a balancing act. But, first and foremost, safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking. But I think, then, we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision—what sort of training and support they have. At the moment, that is a struggle for us, because we're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is—. But, to actually offer some additional training is a challenge."", ""Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands, and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum, of course. What are the challenges? I'll begin with the WLGA, in general, and ask you, in both your areas, what are the challenges to ensure that EOTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum, and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them? What are the challenges associated with that?"", ""David Hopkins: In general terms—. You differentiate there between EOTAS and PRUs. PRUs: clearly, we know that they are following a set curriculum; they are inspected; they are under the control of the local authorities. So, we're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there. Where home tuition is provided through the local authority, as has been discussed, again, there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving. You can't always guarantee what then happens in the home. As you say, particular things happen there, and they may not get that. But that's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle. It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned. The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer. I couldn't give you a definitive one of what's happening across Wales. My colleagues can probably tell you what's happening in their localities, and that would be helpful. But in general: PRUs, yes, we'd be satisfied; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority, yes, we would be satisfied; other areas, we would not be able to give a definitive answer on, is my guess."", 'Sian Gwenllian AM: And does that worry you?', 'David Hopkins: Me?', 'Sian Gwenllian AM: The WLGA.', ""David Hopkins: Of course it's a concern.

What did Sharon Davies think of the role that local authorities should take in the quality assurance of individual intuition?|Sharon Davies expressed her strong objection to the exclusions caused by tuition or safeguarding. She pointed out that the difficulty with home tuition was the limited access the local authority could get into the families. The quality of home tuition was difficult to assure, unless the families invited them there, which was a really rare situation. All in all, the role of local authorities was restricted in this aspect.|"['Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. So, to what extent, then, do local authorities have clear strategies for support and reintegration, and a continuum of provision to meet the needs of learners who are either at risk of exclusion, or disengagement?', ""Nick Williams: Well, we've just developed a behaviour and well-being strategy, which, with our schools—and I'm aware, because I work in the south-west and mid Wales region, and I know some of the other local authorities have something similar, and, similarly, I chair the EOTAS network across Wales, and I know many local authorities are going in that direction, so that has a tiered approach, or staged approach, or whichever, so that there's universal provision.

I can only speak for Torfaen—we've been working really hard on our exclusions and working with our schools to ensure that the curriculum is broad and balanced, and accounts for every learner within the system."", 'Nick Williams: I can only speak for Swansea. We know, as part of that plan that we ask our schools to send in, they have to put down where that provision is. And obviously, as part of the visits, as well, to the schools by the challenge advisers, the school should be monitoring that provision and quality assuring that provision.', 'Janet Finch-Saunders AM: And how is safeguarding monitored in terms of privately run EOTAS? Independent.', 'Nick Williams: The schools would have to make sure that—', 'Janet Finch-Saunders AM: But is that happening, do you know?', ""Nick Williams: Yes, because schools do take safeguarding very, very seriously. They see the importance of it. It's their prime driver in many ways."", 'Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And is there a role for local authorities in quality assuring, monitoring or evaluating the EOTAS provision organised by individual schools?', ""Nick Williams: Yes, but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use, in our experience. So, if it's MTP or something through the college, like a mechanics course or something like that, we're probably using it ourselves. So, it is quality assured, if you like, by two sides."", ""Sharon Davies: In Torfaen, our secondary schools have set out their own TCP—Torfaen curriculum panel—which looks at alternative provision. So, you've got senior leaders there who attend those meetings. The meetings are facilitated and they're currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school is doing because, sometimes, it's worked in the past, but what they're seeing now is that it's not quite working now, and it's understanding why. Is it due to the complexity of the learners coming through? Or is it that the providers are not offering what the learners are seeking any more? So, it's looking as well at, coming back to that curriculum offer, is it the right curriculum offer for those learners? And the training of the staff, do we have the right staff? It's capacity, then. It's just quality assuring the provision. Just because it's worked in the past—it's about keeping that momentum going."", 'Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And should local authorities take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition?', 'Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I suppose individual tuition in terms of each individual, I would assume that means.', 'Sharon Davies: Okay.', ""Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I wouldn't like to think anyone was falling through—"", 'Lynne Neagle AM: I think the purpose of the question is around home tuition, yes.', ""Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Individual tuition in terms of we wouldn't want any child, if they're away from a main-school setting, to slip through the net in terms of tuition, or safeguarding even."", ""Sharon Davies: I suppose the difficulty with home tuition is, as a local authority, we're restricted on how much access we get into the home."", ""Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Well, I appreciate that, and that's the—[Inaudible.]"", ""Sharon Davies: Therefore, it's really difficult then to quality assure, because unless the families invite us in there's very little—. We are restricted in that respect."", ""Janet Finch-Saunders AM: What about if they're in a private setting?"", ""Nick Williams: If they're following a restricted timetable or whatever, because maybe they're school anxious and so on, and we're trying to get them into our provision like that, the home-tuition staff work for us. We don't use agency staff, for instance, to go in and provide a few hours of provision, or to go to the local library. So, for whatever reason their needs at the moment can't be met in a school or in approved provision, then the staff who do provide some education, or if it's for medical reasons, they work for us in the local authority. So, we're not using—"", 'Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Is that widespread around Wales?', ""Nick Williams: I don't really know the answer to that, I'm sorry. I can only speak for Swansea."", ""Sharon Davies: We're very similar to that."", ""David Hopkins: Historically, there has been a general pattern, and if you're making a provision you will quality assure it, clearly.

Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. In terms of school accountability measures, do you think that they have had an impact on the rise in exclusions?
Sharon Davies: When we're looking at the accountabilities, there's a huge amount of pressures on schools to perform, and I think the whole culture that the schools are within does play an element of it to some—. There is a shift in that culture. We are seeing a change with the interim measures coming on board, but I think there's going to be a lag in the system before we see that having a knock-on effect on our learners, because, undoubtedly, there are pressures on schools.
Lynne Neagle AM: So, you've seen an improvement since the capped 9 has been brought in?
Sharon Davies: I think it's early to say, but certainly we're working towards that improvement. I can only speak for Torfaen—we've been working really hard on our exclusions and working with our schools to ensure that the curriculum is broad and balanced, and accounts for every learner within the system.
Nick Williams: I can only speak for Swansea. We know, as part of that plan that we ask our schools to send in, they have to put down where that provision is. And obviously, as part of the visits, as well, to the schools by the challenge advisers, the school should be monitoring that provision and quality assuring that provision.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: And how is safeguarding monitored in terms of privately run EOTAS? Independent.
Nick Williams: The schools would have to make sure that—
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: But is that happening, do you know?
Nick Williams: Yes, because schools do take safeguarding very, very seriously. They see the importance of it. It's their prime driver in many ways.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And is there a role for local authorities in quality assuring, monitoring or evaluating the EOTAS provision organised by individual schools?
Nick Williams: Yes, but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use, in our experience. So, if it's MTP or something through the college, like a mechanics course or something like that, we're probably using it ourselves. So, it is quality assured, if you like, by two sides.
Sharon Davies: In Torfaen, our secondary schools have set out their own TCP—Torfaen curriculum panel—which looks at alternative provision. So, you've got senior leaders there who attend those meetings. The meetings are facilitated and they're currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school is doing because, sometimes, it's worked in the past, but what they're seeing now is that it's not quite working now, and it's understanding why. Is it due to the complexity of the learners coming through? Or is it that the providers are not offering what the learners are seeking any more? So, it's looking as well at, coming back to that curriculum offer, is it the right curriculum offer for those learners? And the training of the staff, do we have the right staff? It's capacity, then. It's just quality assuring the provision. Just because it's worked in the past—it's about keeping that momentum going.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And should local authorities take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I suppose individual tuition in terms of each individual, I would assume that means.
Sharon Davies: Okay.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I wouldn't like to think anyone was falling through—
Lynne Neagle AM: I think the purpose of the question is around home tuition, yes.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Individual tuition in terms of we wouldn't want any child, if they're away from a main-school setting, to slip through the net in terms of tuition, or safeguarding even.
Sharon Davies: I suppose the difficulty with home tuition is, as a local authority, we're restricted on how much access we get into the home.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Well, I appreciate that, and that's the—[Inaudible.]
Sharon Davies: Therefore, it's really difficult then to quality assure, because unless the families invite us in there's very little—. We are restricted in that respect.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: What about if they're in a private setting?
Nick Williams: If they're following a restricted timetable or whatever, because maybe they're school anxious and so on, and we're trying to get them into our provision like that, the home-tuition staff work for us. We don't use agency staff, for instance, to go in and provide a few hours of provision, or to go to the local library. So, for whatever reason their needs at the moment can't be met in a school or in approved provision, then the staff who do provide some education, or if it's for medical reasons, they work for us in the local authority. So, we're not using—
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Is that widespread around Wales?
Nick Williams: I don't really know the answer to that, I'm sorry. I can only speak for Swansea.
Sharon Davies: We're very similar to that.
David Hopkins: Historically, there has been a general pattern, and if you're making a provision you will quality assure it, clearly. I think your question is probably about other forms of provision and how do you quality assure those.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Absolutely, yes.

What did the meeting discuss about issues on the special education and recruitment of professional staff?|PRU was supposed to collaborate with schools to arrange special curriculums to meet the students' special needs. This not only had something to do with finance but was also related to the recruitment of professional staff. The training for special education ought to be included in the professional training system.|"[""Nick Williams: Well, one of the things I think that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector. We meet on a regular basis, and that's nationally. And the EOTAS group meets regionally as well. So, there's definitely a better sharing of practice. We put on some very, very good conferences as one form of professional learning. But it's also important—. And we're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider, or it's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits, joint visits, to provision and also using the expertise that we do have within the sector to work more closely with our schools, and vice versa, particularly around the curriculum. And I think this is the opportunity the new curriculum provides, providing our staff have the funding to do that and the opportunities we need to be creating around that as well. But in the past, there might well have been some staff who perhaps hadn't had those school experiences and vice versa."", ""Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Can I just ask you about transition arrangements, because I know some of the issues that have arisen in my own constituency is when a pupil is in a PRU and then trying to get back into mainstream education? It isn't a clear, sort of, going from one to the other—sometimes a child can find themselves at home because they're not able to get back into the school setting, the main school setting. How are you addressing that?"", ""Nick Williams: Well, again, I can only speak for ourselves. We've had a big investment of time, and there will be money and through band B, we're building a brand-new PRU provision in Swansea, which will be open in January 2021. So, we've recognised that, so that we have our staff working very closely with the schools. There's an integration through a part-time timetable back into school, and we continue to support them during that process. But then, when they're back in school, that support doesn't stop—that support continues, and then there's a managed reduction in that support. And that's proven very successful."", ""Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands, and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum, of course. What are the challenges? I'll begin with the WLGA, in general, and ask you, in both your areas, what are the challenges to ensure that EOTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum, and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them? What are the challenges associated with that?"", ""David Hopkins: In general terms—. You differentiate there between EOTAS and PRUs.

It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned. The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer. I couldn't give you a definitive one of what's happening across Wales. My colleagues can probably tell you what's happening in their localities, and that would be helpful.

At the moment, a newly qualified teacher can't work in this type of provision, which you can argue, that's fine, they need to perhaps get mainstream first. But we need a group of people in the future to fill those gaps. So, that should be built in to their teacher training, and even through their ongoing professional development, both ways—staff actually coming out to schools, going into our provision and vise versa—because you can also get very isolated if you've worked in PRUs for—.

What was the major challenge of training professional staff for special education?|Dawn Bowden pointed out that there were a very small number of staff members working in the provision area, and the capacity for them to access professional training was limited. Sharon Davies agreed and added that though the situation had been bettered by the Internet technology, there was still not much opportunity for the ones who desired to specialize in the area.|"[""Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes.

However, the most recent inspection is very positive, and not that we recognise that there's no work to be done; we're not being complacent. But to answer your question, I think the biggest challenge is the capacity. So, I suppose that comes down to additional funding, because I'd like a dedicated educational psychologist spending their time possibly only with our PRU youngsters and EOTAS provision, but we haven't got the capacity because of the demands on us from the wider system."", 'Dawn Bowden AM: And—. Sorry, go on.', ""Sharon Davies: It's kind of what Nick said about capacity, but it's also ensuring the right staff as well, because sometimes, you may have them, but if they move on, or retire, or whatever, there's not a bus load, if you like, of people with that expertise.

The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer. I couldn't give you a definitive one of what's happening across Wales. My colleagues can probably tell you what's happening in their localities, and that would be helpful. But in general: PRUs, yes, we'd be satisfied; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority, yes, we would be satisfied; other areas, we would not be able to give a definitive answer on, is my guess.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And does that worry you?
David Hopkins: Me?
Sian Gwenllian AM: The WLGA.
David Hopkins: Of course it's a concern. If you can't guarantee quality in any shape or form for a young person, it is a concern.
Nick Williams: We've probably—[Inaudible.]—in Swansea if you look at the inspections of the provision. Going back some years, they weren't— What you're describing, it was true. However, the most recent inspection is very positive, and not that we recognise that there's no work to be done; we're not being complacent. But to answer your question, I think the biggest challenge is the capacity. So, I suppose that comes down to additional funding, because I'd like a dedicated educational psychologist spending their time possibly only with our PRU youngsters and EOTAS provision, but we haven't got the capacity because of the demands on us from the wider system.
Dawn Bowden AM: And—. Sorry, go on.
Sharon Davies: It's kind of what Nick said about capacity, but it's also ensuring the right staff as well, because sometimes, you may have them, but if they move on, or retire, or whatever, there's not a bus load, if you like, of people with that expertise. Because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise, and therefore, it's quite niche, and once that person has moved on, it's really difficult to start all over again.
Dawn Bowden AM: I understand that.
Sharon Davies: Absolutely. It's more than just one person—it's the whole training package that goes around that capacity as well.
Nick Williams: But I think that's something we could do better. I think we need to be more—. Because that's not just down to money, it's making sure that we perhaps offer, through our teacher training colleges, the opportunity for them to spend some time. At the moment, a newly qualified teacher can't work in this type of provision, which you can argue, that's fine, they need to perhaps get mainstream first. But we need a group of people in the future to fill those gaps. So, that should be built in to their teacher training, and even through their ongoing professional development, both ways—staff actually coming out to schools, going into our provision and vise versa—because you can also get very isolated if you've worked in PRUs for—. You've got very specialist skills, but you perhaps need those wider experiences as well. So, we could be doing more there, and I think that's probably, the group I chair, a discussion we need to have.
Dawn Bowden AM: And on that point, actually, we did hear from Estyn the point you were making about the staff leaving and there are very small numbers of staff working in that provision. There really isn't the capacity for them to access professional training. Is that your experience? And if so, what can we do about that?
Sharon Davies: I think it's limited. I think it is getting better, as Nick mentioned. There are networks now, there are conferences. It is an improving picture, but I think it's limited.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, okay. So, is there any way that local authorities can encourage specialist teachers and educational psychologists to actually share expertise with independent providers of EOTAS?
Nick Williams: Yes, but again, it's a capacity issue, because if we take them out of the provision, it's difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands. So, it's not an easy conundrum.

Summarize the conclusion of the discussion about the transport for EOTAS learners in rural areas.|There were more issues related to transport for EOTAS learners in the rural areas of Wales. The distance that the learners had to cover was huge, for they had to get a provision in Powys. However, WLGA (Welsh Local Government Association) admitted that this issue had not been investigated yet would be in investigation very soon.|"[""Nick Williams: Sorry.

What did Marketing think of the incorporation of current fashion trends in the prototype when making a simulation market evaluation of the new remote control?|Marketing initially doubted that Industrial Designer was limited in the use of materials for the prototype, which would harm the fashion style. Marketing was soon convinced by Industrial Designer, however, that the changeable faces would allow users to customize their remote controls. Besides, the rubber case would give a spongy feel. Marketing thus rated one point for Industrial Designer's style design.|"['User Interface: Which is {disfmarker}', 'Project Manager: But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product', ""Industrial Designer: No d not not actually .

User Interface: Which is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product
Industrial Designer: No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing .
User Interface: No .
Project Manager: once it's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Look up to it .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics ,
Project Manager: Thank you very much .
Industrial Designer: as that is {disfmarker} that's the company logo {gap} .
User Interface: Yay .
Project Manager: Wrapping it all up , okay .
Marketing: Well done .
Project Manager: Um I've now got evaluation criteria .
Marketing: Certainly .
User Interface: So this is the one . Sorry .
Project Manager: It's to be presented {gap} .
Industrial Designer: There you go . {gap} .
Marketing: Logged in ? Thank you . Oops .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Evaluation . {gap} .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm um I I think this is {gap} chip .
Project Manager: It's quite similar to what it was before , though .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Sorry .
Marketing: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . {vocalsound} So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: {gap}
Marketing: So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered {disfmarker} Okay ,
User Interface: two point f
Marketing: and we're just waiting for your rating
Project Manager: It's just two point five for that one .
Marketing: f
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Two point five , okay . Losing one decimal place , that's okay .
User Interface: One is a {gap} , seven is false , okay .
Marketing: So what are you rating for this one , Paw ?
User Interface: Two .
Marketing: Two , okay . So that is eight . That brings it down to two ,
Industrial Designer: Two .
Marketing: nice and simple , yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .
Industrial Designer: Two .
Marketing: Two .
Project Manager: I would say a two . I would say a two .
Marketing: A two , okay .
User Interface: Two .
Marketing: Two . I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} We'll just put almost two ,
Project Manager: One point seven f five .
Marketing: because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .
Project Manager: Okay , mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Okay . Or we {disfmarker} or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at
Industrial Designer: D_ .
Marketing: it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .
Industrial Designer: One . Yeah .
Marketing: Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?
Industrial Designer: No , no , the the base colour was um {vocalsound} white or or like or l sort of a light blue ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , one .
Marketing: One
Project Manager: One .
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: and one , good .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} So ,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker}
Marketing: how do we feel about this ?
Industrial Designer: {gap} {gap}
Marketing: We've got our our {disfmarker} we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . {vocalsound} Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?
Project Manager: I don't think so .
Industrial Designer: W I thin yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Marketing: We happy to go ahead ?
Project Manager: I think we {disfmarker} yeah . I think we're set .
Industrial Designer: yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
Project Manager: Do much apart from having a huge big {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ?
Project Manager: Don't think so .
Industrial Designer: No .
Marketing: Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there .

What's the conclusion of the minimization of repetitive strain injury when making simulation market evaluation of the new remote control?|Marketing considered the design of pointers unfeasible, for many users were prone to zap. Project Manager recommended the slight and small-sized buttons with more space in between. Regretfully, the team failed to come up with a perfectly feasible solution to the problem. The team thus gave low rate points to the prototype's minimization of repetitive strain injury.|"['User Interface: Which is {disfmarker}', 'Project Manager: But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product', ""Industrial Designer: No d not not actually .

Industrial Designer: but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any {disfmarker} basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .
Marketing: Right .
User Interface: Any {disfmarker}
Marketing: So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .
User Interface: Right .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Okay .
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker}
Marketing: And the spongy feel is no problem with that .
User Interface: Yeah , because you'll be having a {disfmarker} Because of the rubber case .
Industrial Designer: No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that {disfmarker} otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic .
Marketing: Okay . In that case it's got to be a one for me .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .
Marketing: Yep .
Project Manager: One .
Marketing: Everybody ? Okay .
User Interface: One .
Marketing: {vocalsound} That part was nice and easy .

Industrial Designer: Mm .

Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_
Industrial Designer: It's meant to be .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: it's meant to . Um
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: maybe because it's slightl
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: with the size that we've got it's quite small ,
User Interface: like uh we spent times individually . I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , I think it's new ideas in general ,
Marketing: It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in ,
Project Manager: rather than {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: it so it's {disfmarker} I mean nothing is new ,
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: but it's applying it to a d in a different area .
Industrial Designer: Vegetables .
User Interface: {vocalsound} That's mine .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , no . Well
User Interface: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}

Marketing: Absolutely , yeah .
User Interface: The thing is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And as sh as w sorry ,
User Interface: Yep , sorry ,
Project Manager: you go .
User Interface: go on Sarah .
Project Manager: Um as was shown by {vocalsound} your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly .
Industrial Designer: No .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about ,
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned . They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , just jazz it up a bit .
Marketing: Yeah .

Summarize the discussion about cost calculation and budget issues.|The team calculated the cost of the remote control in the Euro. The team included one regular chip, one kinetic cell, one double-curved bottom, one push button, one LCD screen, as well as rubber and plastic materials. The team decided to recommend voice recognition to business customers. Once the budget increased, voice recognition would be incorporated. Overall, the present cost was 12.5 Euros and was under the budget.|"[""Project Manager: but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much ."", 'Marketing: Mm .', ""Project Manager: So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between ."", 'Marketing: Mm-hmm .

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .
Marketing: Mm-hmm . Right .
Project Manager: It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually ,
Marketing: A five , okay .
Industrial Designer: 'cause {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Four .
Marketing: Four and a four okay .
User Interface: Four .
Marketing: Twenty one {disfmarker} is that twenty one ?
User Interface: {gap}
Marketing: So that's four point two five .
Industrial Designer: Yep .
Marketing: And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition ,
User Interface: Voice r recognition .
Marketing: It was the I'm here thing ,
Industrial Designer: yeah .
Marketing: yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} yeah , that's feasible .
Marketing: That sounds good then . I'd go for a {disfmarker} I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or .
Industrial Designer: Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand
Project Manager: A standard .
Industrial Designer: it would be quite loud .
Project Manager: It would be .
Marketing: Right . Okay .
Industrial Designer: So it would be s p
Marketing: You built into the feature .
Project Manager: And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room .
Industrial Designer: yeah .
Project Manager: Right , okay , so {disfmarker}
Marketing: So if we take voice recognition out {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: That'll do it . Twelve point three five .
User Interface: Yeah we are close to the budget .
Marketing: {gap} we are .
Industrial Designer: Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?
User Interface: Two five .
Project Manager: It's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five .
Marketing: Are you sure ? Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there .
Project Manager: Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five ,
Marketing: Right . {vocalsound} Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ?
User Interface: It's twelve point five maybe , then .
Project Manager: isn't it ?
Marketing: Which is less than ten P_ .
User Interface: I don't know what {disfmarker} it said fifty percent of the cost . So half of the price would be {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I think the agenda one was where the um price was , wasn't it ? No .
User Interface: I think it is the first one .
Marketing: That's today's kick off meeting , {gap} .
Project Manager: Twelve point five .
Marketing: Mm . {gap} I thought that's what it was .
User Interface: So we are under the budget .
Project Manager: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Ah .
Project Manager: Well done , people .
Marketing: So we're okay .
Project Manager: So
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah . No .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface: Seems fine .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think that's brilliant .
User Interface: Except voice recognition , everything is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Right , so we've done that . Okay . Product evaluation . We've done room for creativity , haven't we ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: But forcing it onto people ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: yeah . It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want .
Project Manager: And you can't get {disfmarker} you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone ,
Marketing: Mm . Mm .
Project Manager: because the phones have moved on , things like that .
Marketing: Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever ,
Project Manager: Yes .
Marketing: yeah .
Project Manager: It's madness . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: See I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager: In closing {disfmarker} There we go .
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} our costs are below budget with recommendations that they {disfmarker} the budget be increased , but I think {disfmarker} I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well .
Marketing: I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .
Industrial Designer: I think that was just the the physical .
Project Manager: So it looks {disfmarker} well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Maybe fifty percent more .
Project Manager: But I think {disfmarker} but you were saying that that's quite {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think {disfmarker} yeah I don't {disfmarker} from the market research .
Marketing: But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I think we've done what we were required to do ,

What did User Interface think of the replacement of the kinetic batteries when discussing cost calculation and budget issues?|User Interface recommended the standard batteries to replace the kinetic batteries and lower the cost. Marketing was promised by User Interface that the change in battery type would not make any big difference in shape and colours. However, Marketing was still uncertain about the replacement. User Interface further explained that users were used to paying little attention to batteries which were installed internally.|"[""Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And working on the inside we've um already said {disfmarker} d decided on the kinetic batteries , which {disfmarker} actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of {disfmarker}"", 'Project Manager: So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,', 'Industrial Designer: Yeah .

Project Manager: 'cause it's the top part that's {disfmarker} okay .
Industrial Designer: Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in {vocalsound} and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Or something . {vocalsound}

Project Manager: Or , that would be too complicated .
Industrial Designer: Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's {disfmarker} be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .

Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: No , we don't step on anyone's toes . Okay , special colour , do we need that ?
Marketing: Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .
Project Manager: N yeah , okay . {vocalsound} Interface .
User Interface: Push-button .
Industrial Designer: Yeah ,
User Interface: One .
Industrial Designer: the push-button's one and L_C_ display one .
User Interface: An One .
Project Manager: Buttons {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And buttons {disfmarker}
Marketing: S
User Interface: {vocalsound} I think we could change the battery also . Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .
Marketing: Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ?
Project Manager: Has that not gone up ?
Industrial Designer: Well yes .
Marketing: Is it {disfmarker} oh , it's brought it slightly down .
Project Manager: Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot .
Marketing: So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: is that going to make a difference ?
User Interface: Uncurved , flat .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh , it's not made any difference , has it? .
User Interface: No ,
Industrial Designer: No ,
User Interface: it just surprises one .
Industrial Designer: we'll have {disfmarker}
Marketing: It's gone up again .
Project Manager: Oh , it's not calculated it .
Industrial Designer: No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again .
Marketing: Oh .
Project Manager: Okay , there we go .
Marketing: {vocalsound} It's brought it down slightly .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It's not a lot though .
User Interface: {gap} . {vocalsound} I don't think so .
Project Manager: We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though ,
Marketing: Is there anything on the menu {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I think {disfmarker}
Marketing: No .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .
User Interface: Ri I think it's in Euro {gap} .
Project Manager: Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um {vocalsound} and the interface .
Marketing: If we tr um . If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?
User Interface: And going to a regular bat Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , the standard , it {vocalsound} um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away {disfmarker} if you took away {disfmarker}
User Interface: What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery {gap} .
Industrial Designer: If you to
User Interface: It's internal , nobody looks into the battery .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi
Marketing: And people are used to buying batteries ,
Industrial Designer: If if you take away the voice ,
Marketing: they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control .
Industrial Designer: I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it .
User Interface: Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm .
Marketing: Should we see what difference it makes ?
Project Manager: Where's the
Industrial Designer: Yeah i yeah .
Project Manager: where's the voice recognition ?
Industrial Designer: No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker .
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Right , okay .
Industrial Designer: If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .
Project Manager: Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's {disfmarker} that's minus three .
Industrial Designer: They {vocalsound} n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two .
Project Manager: Oh , right . I keep seeing zero . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We can do it some other way ,

What's the conclusion of the incorporation of voice recognition when discussing cost calculation and budget issues?|Industrial Designer implicated that if the kinetic batteries were replaced by the standard batteries, the voice recognition would have to be taken away as well. Project Manager, therefore, made a compromise that the team might provide the voice recognition in an upgraded version for the business class who expected high office specifications.|"[""Marketing: {vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . {vocalsound} Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those .

User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ?
User Interface: Ah , it's perfect .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: we're going to look at these crite So

Marketing: Yes ,
User Interface: okay .
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: we're going to come to {disfmarker} w we'll discuss each one
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Is that okay ?
User Interface: 'Kay .
Marketing: One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . {vocalsound} This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Just write small .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Criteria and rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ?
Project Manager: we can do {disfmarker} it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: You could choose to have that or not .
Marketing: Sure .
Industrial Designer: But they {disfmarker} but I mean in {disfmarker} I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
Marketing: But we're still working to um head o
Project Manager: So should we just change the design specification then ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Make it costly .
Marketing: We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as {disfmarker} this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we {disfmarker} the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: We c we could s
Marketing: But we need to work to that specification to start with .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , we could say {disfmarker}
Marketing: And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers
Project Manager: Okay , we can make the price fit ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I s
Project Manager: and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this ,
Industrial Designer: And then say we recommend {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: because it also sets it apart from the crowd .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah . 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it .
Project Manager: They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: It's {vocalsound} s something completely different associated with your company .
Project Manager: Right , okay , so {disfmarker}
Marketing: So if we take voice recognition out {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: That'll do it . Twelve point three five .
User Interface: Yeah we are close to the budget .
Marketing: {gap} we are .
Industrial Designer: Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?
User Interface: Two five .
Project Manager: It's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five .
Marketing: Are you sure ? Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there .
Project Manager: Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five ,
Marketing: Right . {vocalsound} Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ?
User Interface: It's twelve point five maybe , then .
Project Manager: isn't it ?
Marketing: Which is less than ten P_ .
User Interface: I don't know what {disfmarker} it said fifty percent of the cost . So half of the price would be {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I think the agenda one was where the um price was , wasn't it ? No .
User Interface: I think it is the first one .
Marketing: That's today's kick off meeting , {gap} .
Project Manager: Twelve point five .
Marketing: Mm . {gap} I thought that's what it was .
User Interface: So we are under the budget .
Project Manager: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Ah .
Project Manager: Well done , people .
Marketing: So we're okay .
Project Manager: So
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah . No .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface: Seems fine .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , I think that's brilliant .
User Interface: Except voice recognition , everything is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Right , so we've done that . Okay . Product evaluation . We've done room for creativity , haven't we ?
User Interface: Yeah .

What did the group discuss about the current trend and potential materials?|Marketing proposed that the fancy look and feel were more important than the functionality of the product. The fruit and vegetable theme was the current trend, and marketing himself preferred fruits to vegetables. Therefore, how spongy the material could be should be taken into consideration when choosing the materials. The potential materials to accomplish the fruit and vegetable theme could be a sort of rubber, which was used in the stress balls. The alternative option was to use a cover for it, and choose a colour that fits one's sitting room.|"['Marketing: Ha . Mm .

Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion .
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to {disfmarker} I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: but that's just a personal opinion .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I think
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find {disfmarker} come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Thank you for your attention .
User Interface: So .
Project Manager: I think it's the next {disfmarker} it's the blue one , yeah .
User Interface: Oh , uh , there we go . {vocalsound} Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} I actually wasn't aware of the {vocalsound} new trends in electronics
Project Manager: {vocalsound}

Project Manager: Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh {disfmarker} Okay , alright anyway . Um {vocalsound} here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying {disfmarker} we're gonna try to talk about , um {vocalsound} what kind of uh {disfmarker} how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . {vocalsound} Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of {disfmarker} I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?
Project Manager: Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: and I never get it .
Project Manager: yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Never ever .
User Interface: So , but {disfmarker}
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ?
Marketing: Well on the telly .
Industrial Designer: Or on the T_V_ too .
User Interface: On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those {disfmarker} like okay now I hit this {disfmarker} you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .
Project Manager: Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way ,
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: so that fits with the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are {vocalsound} really hot right now , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: B Yeah .
Marketing: Did you did you get that pc picture on {disfmarker} did they provide you with that picture on the web ?
User Interface: Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's quite interesting . What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh god . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , I was gonna say .
User Interface: Oh .
Industrial Designer: You said uh people want spongy .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um , one of your {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's {gap} in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy .

What did the Industrial Designer say about component design?|Industrial Designer thought some parts needed custom design, and other parts should just use standard. For example, the case needed custom design to protect the remote and the locator, and the circuit board needed custom design as well, while the buttons and the wheels, radio sender and receiver were all standard parts. In addition, beeper or other noise things were needed as well for locating the remote. Rubber, plastic, wood and titanium were options of materials, but better not titanium. Regular chips were required if the iPod-style wheel button was used.|"[""Industrial Designer: So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel .

Project Manager: 'S good .
Marketing: Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material
Project Manager: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: which is quite shocking .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} A relaxing squashy ball . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That you can p
User Interface: That's in the shape of a fruit , like a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: well I {disfmarker} see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: and I'm thinking how do you change the hard {disfmarker} would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: This is just {disfmarker} Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy .
Marketing: Oh , okay , yeah . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That {disfmarker} see I was thinking this s
Marketing: Which is cheaper .
Project Manager: sorry {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually .
Project Manager: I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing .
Industrial Designer: Oh . Mm .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: And like this {disfmarker} you could have like you could have like cherries and {vocalsound} things around there .
User Interface: Oh I like that shape .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um but {disfmarker}

Project Manager: I was thinking if it was like this {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: So you're holding a squishy ball
Project Manager: 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy {disfmarker}

User Interface: It's like it has to be s
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But uh it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: No but it does it automatically .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}

Marketing: I don't know .
Project Manager: I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But if someone {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark .
Industrial Designer: That was me .
Project Manager: Was that you ?
Industrial Designer: Yes .
Project Manager: Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .
Marketing: Oh , a dynamo is {disfmarker} ah , {vocalsound} it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .
Industrial Designer: Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So I sort of picked battery .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's quite sweet .
Industrial Designer: We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .

Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Thank you for your attention .
User Interface: So .
Project Manager: I think it's the next {disfmarker} it's the blue one , yeah .
User Interface: Oh , uh , there we go . {vocalsound} Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} I actually wasn't aware of the {vocalsound} new trends in electronics
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um {vocalsound} fabrics . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh {disfmarker} Okay , alright anyway . Um {vocalsound} here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying {disfmarker} we're gonna try to talk about , um {vocalsound} what kind of uh {disfmarker} how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . {vocalsound} Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of {disfmarker} I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?
User Interface: 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this {disfmarker} it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um {vocalsound} the wheel
Project Manager: You need a screen for it ?
User Interface: you {disfmarker} it seems like you would need a screen .
Industrial Designer: You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So {disfmarker}
User Interface: But like if you think about it {disfmarker} yeah but if {disfmarker} so is it just {disfmarker} okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?
Project Manager: We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ ,
User Interface: Are we {disfmarker}
Project Manager: that was one of th I I was {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: sorry ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I I meant to update you on that . Um .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Alright . Okay .
Marketing: But the screen can come up on the telly , the {disfmarker} she said .
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: That correct ?
User Interface: So anyway if {disfmarker} well we just {disfmarker} we need to {disfmarker} Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I was thinking {disfmarker} okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna {disfmarker} I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a {disfmarker} right .
Marketing: Graphical interface ?
User Interface: Yeah like you're g
Marketing: Uh on the {disfmarker} you can have it on the telly though .
User Interface: Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um {disfmarker} So you're either {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like {disfmarker} from five to six you could tap or someth
Project Manager: Right .
User Interface: And then there's also the concern about you know um {vocalsound} how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um {vocalsound} you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,
Project Manager: Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} I'd think that the screen would be better ,
User Interface: like {disfmarker}
Project Manager: because you could have that menu option , sort of {disfmarker}
User Interface: I would think so too , like {disfmarker} So I mean {disfmarker} and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: but then again it would {disfmarker} it does make kind of {disfmarker} if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: It's more expensive according to the design people .
User Interface: m yeah .
Project Manager: Uh . {vocalsound}

Marketing: well I {disfmarker} see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: and I'm thinking how do you change the hard {disfmarker} would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: This is just {disfmarker} Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy .
Marketing: Oh , okay , yeah . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That {disfmarker} see I was thinking this s
Marketing: Which is cheaper .
Project Manager: sorry {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually .
Project Manager: I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing .
Industrial Designer: Oh . Mm .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: And like this {disfmarker} you could have like you could have like cherries and {vocalsound} things around there .
User Interface: Oh I like that shape .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I was thinking sort of a single ball shape .
Project Manager: I was thinking if it was like this {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: So you're holding a squishy ball
Project Manager: 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and then it has a {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .
User Interface: It's like it has to be s
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But uh it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: No but it does it automatically .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Does it automatically ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: I don't know .
Project Manager: I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But if someone {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark .
Industrial Designer: That was me .
Project Manager: Was that you ?
Industrial Designer: Yes .
Project Manager: Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo ,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .
Marketing: Oh , a dynamo is {disfmarker} ah , {vocalsound} it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .
Industrial Designer: Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So I sort of picked battery .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's quite sweet .
Industrial Designer: We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .
Industrial Designer: It {vocalsound} it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .
Project Manager: What does everyone else think ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} The dynamo would be interesting {vocalsound} .
Marketing: No . But dynamo {disfmarker} the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it {vocalsound} creates energy on its own .
Project Manager: What about Kryptonite ? {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh .
Marketing: Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: Don't know the cost .
Industrial Designer: Didn't have enough data to actually {disfmarker}
Marketing: Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?
Industrial Designer: All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost .
Marketing: Okay . Right .
User Interface: Hmm .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .
Project Manager: What does chip on print mean ?
Industrial Designer: Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh-huh .
Industrial Designer: calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .
Project Manager: Right . So , chip on print is just {disfmarker} means like that they're mass-produced .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .

Marketing: Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either {disfmarker} like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .
Project Manager: Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah .
User Interface: What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can {disfmarker} so so maybe one you know {disfmarker} you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing {vocalsound}

Professor B: There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . But by having them both there {disfmarker} The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you .
PhD A: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: And some of the time it 's going to hurt you ,
PhD A: Right .
Professor B: and by combining two information sources if , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker}
PhD A: So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that {disfmarker}
Professor B: That i i I think that 's counter to that idea .
PhD A: Yeah , right .
Professor B: Now , again , it 's {disfmarker} we 're just trying these different things . We don't really know what 's gonna work best . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that .
PhD A: Right .
Professor B: Um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA .
PhD A: Right . Yeah . Well {disfmarker} y
Professor B: Though , maybe not .
PhD A: Yeah . Exactly . I mean , we , uh {disfmarker} we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , um , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , "" Well , uh , yeah , that i you know {disfmarker} th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path .
Professor B: Right .
PhD A: You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . So . I was just wondering {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Professor B: Well , I think that 's a good idea .
PhD A: Yeah .
Professor B: Did {disfmarker} did you do that
PhD D: Yeah , so {disfmarker} Yeah , so that 's the {disfmarker} Yeah . So we 've been thinking about putting it into the neural net also .
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD D: Because they did {disfmarker} that itself {disfmarker}
PhD C: Then you don't have to worry about the thresholds and {disfmarker}
PhD D: There 's a threshold and {disfmarker} Yeah .
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD C: but just {disfmarker}
PhD D: Yeah . So that {disfmarker} that 's , uh {disfmarker}
Professor B: Yeah . So if we {disfmarker} if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then {disfmarker} then that would be a , uh , good thing .
PhD D: Yeah . Yeah .
Professor B: Um , anybody {disfmarker} has anybody {disfmarker} you guys or {disfmarker} or Naren , uh , somebody , tried the , uh , um , second th second stream thing ? Uh .
PhD D: Oh , I just {disfmarker} I just h put the second stream in place and , uh ran one experiment , but just like {disfmarker} just to know that everything is fine .
Professor B: Uh - huh .
PhD D: So it was like , uh , forty - five cepstrum plus twenty - three mel {disfmarker} log mel .
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD D: And {disfmarker} and , just , like , it gave me the baseline performance of the Aurora , which is like zero improvement .
Professor B: Yeah . Yeah .
PhD D: So I just tried it on Italian just to know that everything is {disfmarker} But I {disfmarker} I didn't export anything out of it because it was , like , a weird feature set .
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD D: So .
Professor B: Yeah . Well , what I think , you know , would be more what you 'd want to do is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is , uh , put it into another neural net . Right ?
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: And then {disfmarker} But , yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're not quite there yet . So we have to {vocalsound} figure out the neural nets , I guess .
PhD C: Yeah .
PhD D: The uh , other thing I was wondering was , um , if the neural net , um , has any {disfmarker} because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional {disfmarker} some four plus some {disfmarker} f few more conditions which it hasn't seen , actually ,
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: from the {disfmarker} f f while testing .
PhD C: Yeah , yeah . Right .
PhD D: Um {disfmarker} instead of just h having c uh , those cleaned up t cepstrum , sh should we feed some additional information , like {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} We have the VAD flag . I mean , should we f feed the VAD flag , also , at the input so that it {disfmarker} it has some additional discriminating information at the input ?
PhD C: Hmm - hmm ! Um {disfmarker}
Professor B: Wh - uh , the {disfmarker} the VAD what ?
PhD D: We have the VAD information also available at the back - end .
Professor B: Uh - huh .
PhD D: So if it is something the neural net is not able to discriminate the classes {disfmarker}
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD D: I mean {disfmarker} Because most of it is sil I mean , we have dropped some silence f We have dropped so silence frames ?
Professor B: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: No , we haven't dropped silence frames still .

Professor B: Well , we got a {disfmarker} a video projector in here , uh , and , uh {disfmarker} which we keep on during every {disfmarker} every session we record ,
PhD A: Yeah .
Professor B: which , you know , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} w we were aware of
PhD A: Uh - huh .
Professor B: but {disfmarker} but we thought it wasn't a bad thing .
PhD A: Yeah .
Professor B: I mean , that 's a nice noise source . Uh , and there 's also the , uh {disfmarker} uh , air conditioning .
PhD A: Hmm .
Professor B: Which , uh , you know , is a pretty low frequency kind of thing .
PhD D: So it had like all these different conditions of S N Rs , actually in their training set of neural net .
PhD C: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
PhD D: But after cleaning up you have now a different set of S N Rs , right ?
PhD C: Yeah .
PhD D: For the training of the neural net .
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: And {disfmarker} is it something to do with the mismatch that {disfmarker} that 's created after the cleaning up , like the high mismatch {disfmarker}
PhD C: You mean the {disfmarker} the most noisy occurrences on SpeechDat - Car might be a lot more noisy than {disfmarker}
PhD D: Mm - hmm . Of {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I mean , the SNR after the noise compensation of the SpeechDat - Car .
Professor B: Oh , so {disfmarker} Right . So the training {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the neural net is being trained with noise compensated stuff .
PhD C: Maybe .
PhD D:  Yeah .
PhD C: Yeah , yeah .
Professor B: Which makes sense ,
PhD D: Yeah .
Professor B: but , uh , you 're saying {disfmarker} Yeah , the noisier ones are still going to be , even after our noise compensation , are still gonna be pretty noisy .
PhD D: Yeah .
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: Yeah , so now the after - noise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of S N Rs than that was originally there in the training set . Of TIMIT . Because in the TIMIT it was zero to some clean .
Professor B: Right . Yes .
PhD D: So the net saw all the SNR @ @ conditions .
Professor B: Right .
PhD D: Now after cleaning up it 's a different set of SNR .
Professor B: Right .
PhD D: And that SNR may not be , like , com covering the whole set of S N Rs that you 're getting in the SpeechDat - Car .
Professor B: Right , but the SpeechDat - Car data that you 're seeing is also reduced in noise by the noise compensation .
PhD C: They are a little bit better . Yeah . But {disfmarker}
Professor B: Did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better ?
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: Say , for the {disfmarker} I mean , it {disfmarker}
PhD C: No , it doesn't .
Professor B: So it 's only the highly mismatched ?
PhD C: No .
Professor B: And it {disfmarker} Remind me again , the "" highly mismatched "" means that the {disfmarker}
PhD C: Clean training and {disfmarker}
Professor B: Uh , sorry ?
PhD C: It 's clean training {disfmarker} Well , close microphone training and distant microphone , um , high speed , I think .
Professor B: Close mike training {disfmarker}
PhD C: Well {disfmarker} The most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing .
Professor B: Right . So {disfmarker} Well , maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech .
PhD C: Separating . Yeah .
Professor B: Wh
PhD C: But {disfmarker} Yeah . I mean , but without the neural network it 's {disfmarker} well , it 's better . It 's just when we add the neural networks .
Professor B: Yeah , right .
PhD C: The feature are the same except that {disfmarker}
Professor B: Uh , that 's right , that 's right . Um {disfmarker}
PhD A: Well that {disfmarker} that says that , you know , the , um {disfmarker} the models in {disfmarker} in , uh , the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features .
PhD C: Yeah .
PhD A: Uh .
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: But , yeah , actually {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} the TIMIT noises {pause} are sort of a range of noises and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises , right ? It 's {disfmarker} it 's pretty different . Isn't it ?

Professor B: And , uh {disfmarker} and sixty - two with the {disfmarker} the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating VAD . And fifty - seven is what you got with the real VAD .
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: That 's great .
PhD C: Uh , yeah , the next thing is , I started to play {disfmarker} Well , I don't want to worry too much about the delay , no . Maybe it 's better to wait
Professor B: OK .
PhD C: for the decision
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD C: from the committee . Uh , but I started to play with the , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , tandem neural network . Mmm I just did the configuration that 's very similar to what we did for the February proposal . And {disfmarker} Um . So . There is a f a first feature stream that use uh straight MFCC features .
Professor B: Mm - hmm .
PhD C: Well , these features actually . And the other stream is the output of a neural network , using as input , also , these , um , cleaned MFCC . Um {disfmarker}
PhD A: Those are th those are th what is going into the tandem net ?
PhD C: I don't have the comp Mmm ?
PhD A: Those two ?
PhD C: So there is just this feature stream , {comment} the fifteen MFCC plus delta and double - delta .
Professor B: No .
PhD D: So , yeah , I 've been exploring a parallel VAD without neural network with , like , less latency using SNR and energy , um , after the cleaning up . So what I 'd been trying was , um , uh {disfmarker} After the b after the noise compensation , n I was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . So that if {disfmarker} if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . And if it is n if it is close to zero , which is {disfmarker} So it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . So I was trying , uh , with full band and multiple bands , m ps uh {disfmarker} separating them to different frequency bands and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them . Uh , the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it {disfmarker} if it can
Professor B: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: g And {pause} it gave me like , uh , one point {disfmarker} One {disfmarker} more than one percent relative improvement . So , from fifty - three point six it went to fifty f four point eight . So it 's , like , only slightly more than a percent improvement ,
Professor B: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: just like {disfmarker} Which means that it 's {disfmarker} it 's doing a slightly better job than the previous VAD ,
Professor B: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: uh , at a l lower delay .
Professor B: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: Um , so , um {disfmarker}
Professor B: But {disfmarker} i d I 'm sorry ,
PhD D: so {disfmarker} u
Professor B: does it still have the median {pause} filter stuff ?
PhD D: It still has the median filter .
Professor B: So it still has most of the delay ,
PhD D: So {disfmarker}
Professor B: it just doesn't {disfmarker}
PhD D: Yeah , so d with the delay , that 's gone is the input , which is the sixty millisecond . The forty plus {pause} twenty .
Professor B: Um {disfmarker} But that 's {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's an interesting thing to try to see , if what 's going on is that in the highly mismatched condition , it 's , um , causing deletions by having this silence probability up {disfmarker} up too high ,
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: at some point where the VAD is saying it 's actually speech .
PhD C: Yeah .
Professor B: Which is probably true .
PhD C: So , m
Professor B: Cuz {disfmarker} Well , the V A if the VAD said {disfmarker} since the VAD is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is right a lot , uh {disfmarker}
PhD C: Yeah .
Professor B: Hmm . Anyway . Might be .
PhD C: Mm - hmm .
Professor B: Yeah . Well , we just started working with it . But these are {disfmarker} these are some good ideas I think .
PhD C: Mm - hmm . Yeah , and the other thing {disfmarker} Well , there are other issues maybe for the tandem , like , uh , well , do we want to , w uh n Do we want to work on the targets ? Or , like , instead of using phonemes , using more context dependent units ?
PhD A: For the tandem net you mean ?
PhD C: Well , I 'm {disfmarker} Yeah .
PhD A: Hmm .
PhD C: I 'm thinking , also , a w about Dan 's work where he {disfmarker} he trained {vocalsound} a network , not on phoneme targets but on the HMM state targets . And {disfmarker} it was giving s slightly better results .
Professor B: Problem is , if you are going to run this on different m test sets , including large vocabulary ,
PhD C: Yeah . Yeah .
Professor B: um ,
PhD C: Uh {disfmarker}

Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .

Project Manager: Okay , so
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: the important thing here is {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .

User Interface: {vocalsound} Scusi . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,
User Interface: Energies and uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?
Project Manager: No , it's not visible .
Industrial Designer: No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . {vocalsound} Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . {vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control .
Project Manager: It's a different {disfmarker} exactly . It's an uni an unique feature ,
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .
User Interface: And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: What should we choose in in design ?
Project Manager: Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .
User Interface: Well , the extra functions .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function .
User Interface: Used option .
Project Manager: Okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .
Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .
Marketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: Well , we skip that .
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .
Industrial Designer: No , no .
Project Manager: No .
User Interface: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}

Industrial Designer: Okay ,
User Interface: Uh and I think the most {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I can imagine when
Project Manager: I agree actually . {vocalsound}
User Interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it ,
Industrial Designer: I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .

Project Manager: Often .
Industrial Designer: No , you're probably right .
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?
Project Manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The design .
Industrial Designer: Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it .
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy
Marketing: And {disfmarker}
Project Manager: by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .
Project Manager: Exactly , exactly .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay , speech .
Industrial Designer: Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .

Industrial Designer: But maybe when we uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but keep the programme and the volume ,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .

User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So that's that's a big advantage , I think .
Project Manager: Okay , g good .

Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: But maybe can {disfmarker} we we can think something smart about it .
Project Manager: Yep .
Industrial Designer: There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .
Project Manager: But {disfmarker} But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?
Industrial Designer: You have to do nothing for it .
Marketing: M {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Twelve dollar fifty . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Because it seems like a very {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe , maybe not .

Project Manager: Uh uh yeah . Okay ,
Industrial Designer: Yes .
Project Manager: great .
User Interface: Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show . Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old .
Project Manager: Uh-huh .
User Interface: So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .
Project Manager: Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , uh b uh most .
Project Manager: Okay , so
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: the important thing here is {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .
Marketing: Oh , user-friendly .
User Interface: Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .
Project Manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
Project Manager: Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Excuse me . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Scusi . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,
User Interface: Energies and uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?
Project Manager: No , it's not visible .
Industrial Designer: No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . {vocalsound} Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . {vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control .
Project Manager: It's a different {disfmarker} exactly . It's an uni an unique feature ,
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .
User Interface: And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: What should we choose in in design ?
Project Manager: Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .
User Interface: Well , the extra functions .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function .
User Interface: Used option .
Project Manager: Okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .
Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .
Marketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: Well , we skip that .
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .
Industrial Designer: No , no .
Project Manager: No .
User Interface: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Nope .
Industrial Designer: So that's out of the question .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .

What did the group discuss about technical issues of the project?|Industrial Designer introduced how the remote control worked and supposed that they should use infrared so that the remote control could communicate with most TV sets. He also proposed to use energy-friendly components and save the cost of circuit boards to develop elaborate lighting techniques. In order to prevent people from losing the remote control, the team decided to implement an audio signal. In terms of energy source, the team preferred to have a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged.|"['Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um we will figure that out .

User Interface: Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show . Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old .
Project Manager: Uh-huh .
User Interface: So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .
Project Manager: Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Yeah , uh b uh most .
Project Manager: Okay , so
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: the important thing here is {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .
Marketing: Oh , user-friendly .
Industrial Designer: Well ,
Project Manager: Well uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: is there not something f something more easily {disfmarker}
User Interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the {disfmarker} their remote .
Industrial Designer: Well , I don't think uh {gap} .
User Interface: Uh that's just uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh {gap} . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: so w we should use have {disfmarker} uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .
User Interface: {gap} just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .
Industrial Designer: Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think .
Project Manager: Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .
Industrial Designer: So that's not a good idea .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . I will .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: because that's his {disfmarker} his field of expertise .
Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: um and it will become more costly also .
Project Manager: Yep .
Industrial Designer: Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp
User Interface: And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?
Industrial Designer: Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .
User Interface: It's a unique item uh {disfmarker}

Industrial Designer: Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,
User Interface: Energies and uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?

Industrial Designer: No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things .

Industrial Designer: There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w
Industrial Designer: yes . In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah . Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . {vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .

Industrial Designer: and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay ,
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh
Project Manager: good .
Industrial Designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . {vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .
User Interface: {vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .
Industrial Designer: Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience .

Project Manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that {disfmarker} we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And this even uh makes it more cheapy .
User Interface: But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: The board .
User Interface: The circuit board .
Industrial Designer: The circuit board .
User Interface: The fewer buttons you can use on it .
Project Manager: No , it's th
Industrial Designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .
Project Manager: yeah .
User Interface: Yeah , okay .
Project Manager: It's the other way around , yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage .
Project Manager: It shouldn't be a big issue .
User Interface: Well it {disfmarker} then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh {disfmarker} especially for the voice recognition .

What would be added to the legislation?|Kirsty Williams AM explained that the area of learning and experience for well-being was already there, and what would be included was the things that matter in the area of learning, and it was going to be put into the legislation.

And just finally from me, then, on pupil referral units: what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation?', ""Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, we've been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, and this has been an area where we've had to think really, really, really, really, really hard. So, what we intend to do for EOTAS and PRU is to set a minimum of what we would expect a child to receive. So, that would be around the four purposes; that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. So, that would be the baseline of our expectation, that every pupil would get that. After that, then there needs to be a discussion and a focus on what is in the best interests of that particular pupil. One of the things we know about sometimes in EOTAS is we have very able and talented students who don't get access to the range of qualifications and courses that they have the capability and the aptitude to do. We also have to consider, though, that for some children they may be out of school for reasons, and telling them that they've got to do a full curriculum may be hugely detrimental to their mental health and well-being. So, for instance, to give an example, you could have a child who's very ill, and saying to them, 'You have to carry the full load of a curriculum' could be inappropriate. So, we'll be setting a minimum standard, as I said, around the purposes, around the cross-cutting themes and health and well-being, and then there will be an expectation that in conjunction with the child and the family an appropriate addition would be put in place to meet the needs of that child, recognising that they could have very different needs. Is that clear?"", ""Lynne Neagle AM: Well, yes, and it's something that we'll probably look to build on when we look at our inquiry on EOTAS, which is coming up. Thank you. That concludes our questions. We've covered a lot of ground. So, can I thank you for attending and thank your officials for coming today? As usual, we will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for your attendance this morning."", 'Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you.']"|"You are an assistant that answers questions about meeting transcripts.

Sian Gwenllian AM: So, will you be adding to those?
Kirsty Williams AM: Adding is not necessarily—no, not adding. But, for instance, the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience. So, they'll be refined, but not added to, and then we will legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original intention.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Will they include mental health and well-being?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, the area of learning and experience for well-being is already there, and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out.
Lynne Neagle AM: They are in the annex to the paper, Siân, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.
Kirsty Williams AM: Claire, am I explaining it okay?
Claire Bennett: Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. These are the essence of the core content. So, the idea is to make sure that those are consistent, and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them. But the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'—it was never what was intended. They were always intended to represent, as a whole, the learning that every learner should get. They won't be literally in the Bill, because, obviously, you might want to change the emphasis, so that'll be provided for in subordinate legislation, but the provision will be there, and they will have the status of something that's not optional, basically, for a school.
Kirsty Williams AM: No.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And just finally from me, then, on pupil referral units: what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, we've been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, and this has been an area where we've had to think really, really, really, really, really hard. So, what we intend to do for EOTAS and PRU is to set a minimum of what we would expect a child to receive. So, that would be around the four purposes; that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. So, that would be the baseline of our expectation, that every pupil would get that. After that, then there needs to be a discussion and a focus on what is in the best interests of that particular pupil. One of the things we know about sometimes in EOTAS is we have very able and talented students who don't get access to the range of qualifications and courses that they have the capability and the aptitude to do. We also have to consider, though, that for some children they may be out of school for reasons, and telling them that they've got to do a full curriculum may be hugely detrimental to their mental health and well-being. So, for instance, to give an example, you could have a child who's very ill, and saying to them, 'You have to carry the full load of a curriculum' could be inappropriate. So, we'll be setting a minimum standard, as I said, around the purposes, around the cross-cutting themes and health and well-being, and then there will be an expectation that in conjunction with the child and the family an appropriate addition would be put in place to meet the needs of that child, recognising that they could have very different needs. Is that clear?
Lynne Neagle AM: Well, yes, and it's something that we'll probably look to build on when we look at our inquiry on EOTAS, which is coming up. Thank you. That concludes our questions. We've covered a lot of ground. So, can I thank you for attending and thank your officials for coming today? As usual, we will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for your attendance this morning.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you.

Sian Gwenllian AM: So, will you be adding to those?
Kirsty Williams AM: Adding is not necessarily—no, not adding. But, for instance, the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience. So, they'll be refined, but not added to, and then we will legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original intention.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Will they include mental health and well-being?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, the area of learning and experience for well-being is already there, and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out.
Lynne Neagle AM: They are in the annex to the paper, Siân, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.
Kirsty Williams AM: Claire, am I explaining it okay?
Claire Bennett: Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. These are the essence of the core content. So, the idea is to make sure that those are consistent, and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them.

Kirsty Williams AM: So, on the face of the Bill, we will make provision to say that the 'what matters' statements have to be delivered. Over time, the 'what matters' statements might change. So the actual wording of the 'what matters' statements will be in secondary legislation; the need to deliver and the requirement, the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement, will be on the face of the Bill.

Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee—
Kirsty Williams AM: We're assuming so.
Lynne Neagle AM: And we'll have an opportunity to influence it. Siân.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Moving on, therefore, to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education, I understand that you've had numerous responses to the White Paper surrounding this particular area. What are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what's been said?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded. It's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths, English, Welsh, science, but there we go; I guess it's the nature of the areas that we're talking about.

What value the government placed on different sectors?|Kirsty Williams AM suggested that Welsh Government had always been big supporters of WISERD (WalesInstitute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods). More research into Welsh education would always be needed. As a Government, all aspects of concerns of Welsh education should be taken into consideration as the government was planning the new curriculum. For instance,  empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teached their children actually gave the government an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of the school children than what they had at the moment.|"['Kirsty Williams AM: Yes.', 'Sian Gwenllian AM: —actually implemented in September—', 'Kirsty Williams AM: In 2022.', 'Sian Gwenllian AM: In 2022, yes.', ""Kirsty Williams AM: And I think what's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in January itself, because that's the bit that schools are really concerned about, and then we will have the process here to underpin it."", ""Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much.

What did the WISERD research suggest about the distinction in schools?|Hefin David AM introduced that the WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams and classroom teachers would share different views towards the change since classroom teachers would be more sceptical. Kirsty Williams AM explained that classroom teachers were absolutely crucial to this, as a result, difficult step had been taken to delay the implementation of the curriculum to same some amount of time to make sure that it was not just school leaders but individual classroom practitioners who had the skills that they would need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allowed them. To ensure this process, different accountability frameworks to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum would be incorporated.|"[""Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to—. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into—that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful—and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful—it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself—it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know—who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school—? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft—typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools—and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them—it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools."", ""Kirsty Williams AM: Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of—. Read the first bit again. Was it—[Interruption.] Accountability, yes."", ""Hefin David AM: Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.'"", ""Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers—understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of—immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems."", 'Hefin David AM: It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment.']"|"You are an assistant that answers questions about meeting transcripts.

So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of—. Read the first bit again. Was it—[Interruption.] Accountability, yes.
Hefin David AM: Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.'
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers—understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of—immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems.
Hefin David AM: It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment.

What did the meeting talk about the model of Scotland?|Hefin David AM asked about what lessons could be learned from the introduction of the Scotish curriculum. Kirsty Williams AM explained some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum, including assessment and content, which had been a crucial part of the process. Also, professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes was an alert to the Welsh government. Steve Davies added that one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content and it could be a fit for the new curriculum.|"[""Steve Davies: As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout—not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system.

Steve Davies: As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout—not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform.
Kirsty Williams AM: The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay.
Kirsty Williams AM: Where?
Hefin David AM: When.
Kirsty Williams AM: The weekend just gone.
Hefin David AM: Right.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know—
Suzy Davies AM: This isn't about assessment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Oh, okay. Go on, then.
Suzy Davies AM: So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods—? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content—
Suzy Davies AM: Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this.
Steve Davies: In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think—again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually—the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups.

How would the money for supporting teachers help in the preparation of the implementation?|To answer Dawn Bowden AM's question, Kirsty Williams AM first indicated that the money was not an insignificant amount but the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. The money was being made available to each and every school and had empowered head teachers to think about the professional needs of the school and the practitioners in the school. Also it was aimed at a national level, but to start with, schools would be assessed individually.|"[""Suzy Davies AM: Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you."", ""Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar."", ""Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. I'll keep my questions shorter."", 'Lynne Neagle AM: The next questions are from Dawn Bowden.', ""Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Yes, just around preparations for the implementation, really. You touched on this briefly in response to some questions from Hefin David earlier on, but I'm just interested to know how the money that you announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation, how that's actually been used. What specifically have teachers been doing to prepare for its implementation? I know you've set aside about £24 million over two years. So, it's not an insignificant amount. I just wondered how that was being utilised."", ""Kirsty Williams AM: You're right, first of all, it's not an insignificant amount; it's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. So, you're right that it is not insignificant, and it was a hard-won resource, I can tell you, from my colleagues. Because, as I said earlier, the curriculum itself can be amazing, but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it, then all this change will be for nothing. So, investing in the profession is absolutely crucial. That money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain. There are other schools that maybe are only beginning now, now that it's published, to be really engaging with the curriculum."", ""Dawn Bowden AM: So, there hasn't been a national programme, as such."", ""Steve Davies: Yes. There were 60 applicants from 170 previous pioneer schools. We've had 16—four per region. It was important that we engaged with the regions to get their view, and we've had evaluation being carried out—"", ""Claire Bennett: Yes. So, during the first term of work, we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole—so, take the whole curriculum guidance and then think, 'How would I apply that in the school?, Does it make sense?, Can we work with it?, What are the issues?, What are the questions that arise for us for assessment?', and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on, 'If I were putting this into practice—'. So, it's slightly different to the feedback we've had from other people, which has been more, 'Maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording' and kind of quite practical, and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school. That's been drawn together into an overall report, drawing out the themes, by Wavehill, who are a kind of research company. It's been really useful, and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week. Having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable, in just making us think, even with all the practitioners that have been involved, 'How do we make this work for schools?', given that we've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically. So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically.""]"|"You are an assistant that answers questions about meeting transcripts.

What did the meeting discuss about the innovation schools?|Kirsty Williams AM pointed out that all schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into innovation schools, as the next phase. There would be both a downside and an upside for the programme of innovation schools. At this stage, it should be better to move away from the original 's AM concluded that pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. In this case, school with a specific aspect of strength should be encouraged to apply.|"[""Kirsty Williams AM: I think what's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession, we are doing it with our profession. So, in the spirit of co-construction, the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present.\xa0So, Members will be aware that we've slightly changed the model. We had our pioneer school model and we have slightly refined that now. Pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward, and we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools. But above and beyond the innovative schools, we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas, and they're the first part of that process. So, they met last week to begin looking at the feedback, and we'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine. Are there big changes to the concept? No. Opportunities to do things better, explain things better, simplify where possible, where we've been told that that needs to happen, provide greater depth where we've been told that needs to happen—absolutely. We're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those, but in terms of the overall concept, then no, no significant changes."", 'Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. And what are the steps now before the final curriculum is published in January 2020?', 'Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Siân has a supplementary. If I could ask as well, maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools.', ""Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you for that clarification. My final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in Wales. So, teachers trained in England apply for jobs in Wales, but they obviously haven't been trained in the new curriculum. How are we actually going to deal with that?"", ""Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, you're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in Wales will teach in England and teachers trained in England or who have worked in England will come across the border, as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools. I think that that will continue to happen. Indeed, when I'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues, I think Wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals, as well as an exciting new curriculum. So, I think, actually, potentially, we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it'll be a great place to be a professional. Clearly, already in some ways, programmes of study are already distinctive in Wales. We have a different exam board, if you're teaching at a secondary level. So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. I believe that that's not a barrier to people continuing to do that. Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. So, I do not see that this is an insurmountable issue."", ""Dawn Bowden AM: So, you'll still be recruiting on the basis of skills and adaptability and so on."", 'Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, of course.']"|"You are an assistant that answers questions about meeting transcripts.

How was awareness and understanding of human rights embedded in the new curriculum?|Kirsty Williams AM explained that children's rights and human rights had been key considerations throughout the design, and this was currently set out in overarching guidance and the government continued to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And initial assessment from the children's commissioner's office had demonstrated that what was proposed in the new curriculum was a big stepforward. Also, the current existing output of that engagement and feedback had been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning, which was certainly a powerful contribution.|"[""Kirsty Williams AM: Children's rights, human rights—they've been key considerations throughout the design, and this is currently set out in overarching guidance and we continue to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And I'm delighted that the children's commissioner took the time to write to me during the feedback phase to say that they were very pleased that their initial assessment demonstrates that what we're proposing is a big step forward."", ""Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. And how do you respond to the concerns expressed in the children's commissioner’s quarterly report of July 2019 that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage? And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period."", ""Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people, as I said at the beginning. We had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning.

Meeting Transcript:
Kirsty Williams AM: Children's rights, human rights—they've been key considerations throughout the design, and this is currently set out in overarching guidance and we continue to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And I'm delighted that the children's commissioner took the time to write to me during the feedback phase to say that they were very pleased that their initial assessment demonstrates that what we're proposing is a big step forward.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. And how do you respond to the concerns expressed in the children's commissioner’s quarterly report of July 2019 that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage? And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people, as I said at the beginning. We had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning. It's a powerful contribution and I think will actually effect change, especially in how the 'what matters' statements are worded.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Siân.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Turning to the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum, the Learned Society of Wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think there could well be a different decision at a later date, but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it. Can I just say? In terms of creativity, Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD, especially our partnership with the Arts Council of Wales and creative learning through the arts.
Sian Gwenllian AM: I get that. That's why I don't understand why we're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the PISA. But, I understand.
Kirsty Williams AM: There could well be a different decision, but for 2021 we're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with. I just don't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system. The very opposite is true. We are seen as exemplars by the OECD and some of the work that's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally.
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, you'll think about it for the next round of PISA.
Kirsty Williams AM: Oh gosh, that shows that Siân thinks that I'll be here to make that decision. [Laughter.] That's very encouraging indeed. [Laughter.]
Steve Davies: One very quick technical point, Chair. We have not opted out of this. Countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it, and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Janet, you've got a question on physical activity.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Can you give a guarantee that all children and young people, where appropriate, will take part in physical activity under the new curriculum for Wales? Also, how much time per week will the Government expect children and young people to spend undertaking physical activity?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, all children will be given that opportunity, because if they are not then that school would be in breach of the expectations that will be set out in statute.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: How will you monitor it?

What should be included in the implementation of the Welsh dimension?|Sian Gwenllian AM pointed out that the Learned Society of Wales had said that there should be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Kirsty Williams AM introduced that there was a separate programme of work that was looking at resources needed to support the curriculum and it certainly would be a must.|"['Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And, in terms of the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language, how are progression steps and achievement outcomes in Welsh-medium schools going to work and how are they going to work in English-medium schools?', ""Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Just on the Welsh dimension, I think it's really important that whatever resources we have to support the Welsh dimension are really, really, really broad and not confined to specific areas. I was in Swansea University just this week, looking at some of their Technocamp work that they're doing to help us with coding, and we had an amazing conversation about the Welsh contribution to the computing industry. And so my expectation is that that isn't taught in a history lesson—that, actually, when children are learning about coding, they get to hear that Welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology. So, that's—. When I talk about a Welsh dimension, I mean right the way across the curriculum, and I think that's important. With regard to—. The continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught. We have to recognise—. We have to recognise that, and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language, and they have to be contextualised. We recognise that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school, their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school. Vice versa—we've had this discussion before—if a child is going into Welsh medium, their progression in English perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an English-medium school, although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position.

What did the meeting talk about the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language?|Kirsty Williams AM suggested that it was really important that whatever resources there were to support the Welsh dimensionare in a broad level and not confined to specific areas.

Meeting Transcript:
Grad D: Nice coinage .
Grad B: Thank you . uh , of a {disfmarker} of a building . Whether the and this i we actually have a separate feature but I decided to put it on the same line {pause} for space . "" Nice walls "" {vocalsound} which we can look up because I mean if you 're gonna {pause} get real close to a building in the Tango mode , right , there 's gotta be a reason for it . And it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls . The context , which in this case we 've limited to {pause} "" business person "" , "" tourist "" , or {pause} "" unknown "" , the time of day , and "" open to suggestions "" , isn't actually a feature . It 's {pause} "" We are open to suggestions . ""
Grad D: Right . can I just ask the nice walls part of it is that {vocalsound} uh , in this particular domain {disfmarker} you said {disfmarker} be {disfmarker} i it could be on two different lines but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the {disfmarker} that landmark - iness cor is correlated with
Grad B: Oh {disfmarker}
Grad C: No . We have a separate
Grad B: They 're separate things .
Grad C: feature .
Grad D: their being nice w
Grad B: Yeah .
Grad D: OK .
Grad B: I either could put "" nice walls "" on its own line or "" open to suggestions "" off the slide .
Grad C: Like you could have a p
Grad D: And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} By "" nice "" you mean {disfmarker}
Grad C: You {disfmarker} Like you could have a post office with uh {disfmarker} you know , nice murals or something .
Grad B: Right .
Grad D: OK .
Grad B: Or one time I was at this {disfmarker}
Grad D: So "" nice walls "" is a stand in for like architecturally it , uh {disfmarker} significant
Grad B: But see the thing is , if it 's {disfmarker}
Grad C: Architecturally appealing from the outside .
Grad B: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Tourist - y landmarks also happen to be {disfmarker} Wouldn't {disfmarker} couldn't they also be {disfmarker} They 're not exclusive groups , are they ? Like {pause} non - tourist - y landmarks and
Grad A: Or it can be als
Grad B: direct navigational {disfmarker}
Grad D: They 're not mutually exclusive ?
Grad B: Yeah .
Grad D: Right .
Grad B: OK .
Grad D: Right . Definitely .
Grad B: OK , So our initial idea was not very satisfying , {pause} because {disfmarker} uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node . Uh .
Grad D: So , a big flat structure .
Grad B: Right .
Grad D: Right ?
Grad C: Yep .
Grad B: And uh , so we {disfmarker} Reasons being , you know , it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that . If we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort , uh according Bhaskara we 'd be handicapped . I don't know belief - nets very well .
Grad C: Well usually , I mean , you know , N {disfmarker} If you have N features , then it 's two to the N {disfmarker} {pause} or exponential in N .
Grad B: And they wouldn't look pretty . So .
Grad C: Yeah , they 'd all be like pointing to the one node .
Grad B: Uh . So then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ? So the thinking behind that was {vocalsound} we have the features that we 've drawn {pause} from the communication of some {disfmarker} Like , the someone s The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like "" I 'm {disfmarker} "" the {disfmarker} the abstract idea being "" I am a tourist I want to go {pause} to this place .

Grad C: Want to do Vista ,
Grad B: Right .
Grad C: right ? Because {pause} if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry .
Grad B: Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a {disfmarker} like a {pause} navigational point to go to another place .

Grad B: Yeah but if it 's architecturally significant you might be able to see it from {disfmarker} Like you m might be able to "" Vista "" it ,

Grad B: right ? And be able to {disfmarker}
Grad A: Appreciate it .
Grad D: Mm - hmm .
Grad B: Yeah , versus , like , I was at this place in Europe where they had little carvings of , like , dead people on the walls or something .
Grad D: Mm - hmm .
Grad B: I don't remember w
Grad D: Uh - huh .
Grad B: It was a long time ago .
Grad D: There 's a lot of those .
Grad B: But if you looked at it real close , you could see the {disfmarker} the in intricacy of the {disfmarker} of the walls .
Grad D: OK . So that count as {disfmarker} counts as a nice wall .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Grad B: Right .
Grad D: The {disfmarker} OK . Right .
Grad A: The {disfmarker}
Grad D: Something you want to inspect at close range {pause} because it 's interesting .
Grad B: Exactly .
Grad D: OK .
Grad A: Hmm .
Grad B: Robert ?
Grad A: Well there {disfmarker} there is a term {pause} that 's often used . That 's "" saliency "" , or the "" salience "" of an object . And I was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as "" landmark - iness "" . But it 's really not . I mean an object can be very salient
Grad D: Hmm .
Grad A: but not a landmark at all .
Grad D: Not a landmark at all . There 's landmark for um , touristic reasons and landmark for I don't know navigational reasons or something .
Grad A: Yep .
Grad B: Right .
Grad C: Yeah , we meant , uh , touristic reasons .
Grad B: Yeah .
Grad D: OK .
Grad A: Hmm .
Grad B: Right .
Grad D: OK . but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um , goals .
Grad A: Hmm .
Grad C: Yeah .
Grad B: Right .
Grad B: And actually I was {disfmarker} cuz I got a wireless mike on .
Grad D: So a more general thing than "" discussed admission fee "" um , could be {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm just wondering whether the context , the background context of the discourse {vocalsound} might be {disfmarker} I don't know , if there 's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way um , there might be other cues that , say , um , in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes uh , I don't know if that might be {disfmarker}
Grad A: Mm - hmm . I think we {disfmarker}
Grad D: uh , and {disfmarker} and into that node would be various {disfmarker} various things that {disfmarker} that could have specifically come up .
Grad A: I think a {disfmarker} a sort of general strategy here {disfmarker} You know , this is {disfmarker} this is excellent because {disfmarker} um it gets you thinking along these terms {disfmarker} is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before .

Grad B: So instead of single node , for {pause} like , if they said the word "" admission fee "" {disfmarker}
Grad D: Exactly .
Grad B: "" admission fee "" , or maybe , you know , "" how much to enter ""
Grad D: Yeah .
Grad B: or you know something , other cues .

So this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this is a parallel track , you know , there {disfmarker} they hopefully meet ,
Grad D: OK . So in other words this data collection is {pause} more general .
Grad A: but since {disfmarker}
Grad D: It could {disfmarker} it could {pause} be used for not just this task .
Grad A: It should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur , it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being
Grad D: Mm - hmm .
Grad A: and the sort of differences there . So it may get us some more information on the human - machine pragmatics , um , that no one knows anything about , as of yesterday .

Or {disfmarker} Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the {disfmarker} from the data , the hidden variables . Yes , good .

Grad C: Want to do Vista ,
Grad B: Right .
Grad C: right ? Because {pause} if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry .
Grad B: Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a {disfmarker} like a {pause} navigational point to go to another place .
Grad C: Um "" nice walls "" is binary , "" closed "" is binary "" final destination "" , again {disfmarker} Yeah , all those are binary I guess . And "" mode "" is one of three things .
Grad A: So , the {disfmarker} the middle layer is also binary ? No .

Grad A: Uh . It {disfmarker} Yeah . But all those things without question marks are also binary . Right ?
Grad C: Which things ?
Grad A: Nice walls ?
Grad B: Wi

Grad C: Oh . "" Nice walls "" is uh {disfmarker} something that we extract from our world knowledge .

Grad C: Yeah , a Oh yeah . Sorry . It is binary .

Grad C: That 's true . Yeah . OK , I see your point .
Grad A: Yeah . OK .
Grad B: Yeah .
Grad A: I {disfmarker} I gotcha .
Grad D: Uh - huh .
Grad C: Yeah , similarly "" closed "" , I guess .
Grad A: So we can either be in a hurry or not , but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ?
Grad C: Well , we To do that we would add another uh {disfmarker} value for that .
Grad A: Mm - hmm . OK .
Grad C: And that would require s updating the probability distribution for "" mode "" as well .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Grad C: Because it would now have to like uh {disfmarker} take that possibility into account .
Grad D: Mm - hmm . Take a conti
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Grad D: So um , of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases
Grad A: Yeah , yeah .
Grad B: Exactly . That would all f funnel into one node that would {pause} constitute entrance requirements or something like that .
Grad A: So "" pay a visit "" {disfmarker}
Grad D: Mm - hmm .
Grad A: uh uh d
Grad C: Sure .
Grad A: Yeah ?
Grad C: Yeah .
Grad D: I mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse . I mean that 's like the bigger um , version of it .
Grad A: Exactly . Yeah ?

It 's going to get very ugly . But with this way we could say "" OK , these are the {pause} discourse phenomena . They ra may have there own hidden layer {pause} that points to some of {pause} the {disfmarker} the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer .
Grad C: Sure .
Grad A: And the same we will be able to do for syntactic information , the verbs used , the object types used , modifiers . And maybe there 's a hidden layer for that .


Question: How would the middle layer work?

Grad A: Appreciate it .

Grad B: Yeah , versus , like , I was at this place in Europe where they had little carvings of , like , dead people on the walls or something .
Grad D: Mm - hmm .
Grad B: I don't remember w
Grad D: Uh - huh .
Grad B: It was a long time ago .
Grad D: There 's a lot of those .
Grad B: But if you looked at it real close , you could see the {disfmarker} the in intricacy of the {disfmarker} of the walls .
Grad D: OK . So that count as {disfmarker} counts as a nice wall .
Grad A: Mm - hmm .
Grad B: Right .
Grad D: The {disfmarker} OK . Right .
Grad A: The {disfmarker}
Grad D: Something you want to inspect at close range {pause} because it 's interesting .
Grad B: Exactly .
Grad D: OK .
Grad A: Hmm .
Grad B: Robert ?
Grad A: Well there {disfmarker} there is a term {pause} that 's often used . That 's "" saliency "" , or the "" salience "" of an object . And I was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as "" landmark - iness "" . But it 's really not . I mean an object can be very salient
Grad D: Hmm .
Grad A: but not a landmark at all .
Grad D: Not a landmark at all . There 's landmark for um , touristic reasons and landmark for I don't know navigational reasons or something .
Grad A: Yep .
Grad B: Right .
Grad C: Yeah , we meant , uh , touristic reasons .
Grad B: Yeah .
Grad D: OK .
Grad A: Hmm .
Grad B: Right .
Grad D: OK . but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um , goals .
Grad A: Hmm .
Grad C: Yeah .
Grad B: Right .
Grad B: What sort of discourse {pause} processing is uh {disfmarker} are the {disfmarker} How much is built into SmartKom and {disfmarker}
Grad A: It works like this . The uh , um {disfmarker} I mean .

Grad B: Yeah .
Grad C: Oh .
Grad A: So the uh {disfmarker} That will be one {disfmarker} one thing we could do . I actually uh , have {disfmarker} Um , also we can uh , start looking at the SmartKom tables and I will {disfmarker}
Grad B: Right .
Grad A: I actually wanted to show that {pause} to you guys now but um .
Grad B: Do you want to {pause} trade ?
Grad A: Um , no I {disfmarker} I actually made a mistake because it {disfmarker} it fell asleep and when Linux falls asleep on my machine it 's {disfmarker} it doesn't wake up ever , so I had to reboot
Grad D: Oh , no .
Grad A: And if I reboot without a network , I will not be able to start SmartKom , because I need to have a network .
Grad B: Uh {disfmarker}
Grad A: So we 'll do that t maybe uh {disfmarker}
Grad C: But . OK . But once you start {disfmarker} sart start SmartKom you can be on {disfmarker} You don't have to be on a network anymore . Is that the deal ?
Grad A: Yep .
Grad C: Ah , interesting .
Grad B: Why does SmartKom need a network ?
Grad A: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it looks up some stuff that , {pause} you know , is {disfmarker} is that {disfmarker} is in the {disfmarker} written by the operating system only if it {disfmarker} if you get a DHCP request , so it {disfmarker} you know , my computer does not know its IP address , you know ?
Grad B: Ah .
Grad A: You know . So . Unless it boots up with networking .

Summarize the discussion about evaluation criteria of remote control.|The group thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria.

Industrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: but that's not what uh has been asked .
Project Manager: I know , I know .
Industrial Designer: So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
Project Manager: Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .
Industrial Designer: Yes .
Project Manager: Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . {vocalsound} It's not that innovative .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Or however you s pronounce that .
User Interface: Yeah , too bad . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um so , okay . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess {disfmarker}
Marketing: Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah , that's true .
Industrial Designer: Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .
Project Manager: We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree .
Marketing: So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .
Industrial Designer: No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: okay .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: The remote control offers enough features .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?
Marketing: Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable .
Marketing: Yeah , depends .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .
Project Manager: Yeah , I know .
Industrial Designer: So it's quite advanced .
Project Manager: What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has .
Project Manager: I think it has .

Industrial Designer: Yes .
Project Manager: you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals .
Industrial Designer: Has uh the signals sent to it .
User Interface: Yeah .
Marketing: Signal .
Industrial Designer: Absolutely .
Project Manager: Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .
Industrial Designer: Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons .
Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple .
Project Manager: Yep .
Industrial Designer: You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .
User Interface: I'll give a two .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one .
Marketing: Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .

Project Manager: That would have been a thrill .
Industrial Designer: yes , but {disfmarker}
Marketing: So uh also a uh two ?
Industrial Designer: I think uh it's a two .
Project Manager: Yep .
Marketing: Is it easy to use ?
Project Manager: I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure .
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .
User Interface: I think {disfmarker} I think a three .
Industrial Designer: So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more .
Project Manager: Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .

Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user .
Project Manager: Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But that's not possible to fill in ,
Project Manager: Yes , it is .

User Interface: Yeah ,

Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?

Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: M about fifty Euros .
User Interface: yeah .
Industrial Designer: That's quite ex
User Interface: That's price , but w w
Industrial Designer: well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
User Interface: No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .
User Interface: Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .
Project Manager: Bu but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .
Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition
Project Manager: {gap} .
Industrial Designer: and this one does .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So I think it's worth its price .
Project Manager: Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} with these ratings uh
Project Manager: That's counting .
Industrial Designer: Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .
Marketing: should be about one point s seven ,
User Interface: Four six seven eight .

User Interface: So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} I believe uh I believe it's fancy . {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh well appar
Industrial Designer: I believe it's fancy too .
Marketing: Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet .
Project Manager: No .
User Interface: Oh , sorry .
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay , so
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria .
Marketing: Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .
Project Manager: Okay , well {disfmarker}
Marketing: So uh
Project Manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: that's about it .
Project Manager: The production costs . The costs are not under {disfmarker} Can I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this is the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Twenty two .
Project Manager: Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty .
User Interface: Yikes .
Project Manager: And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that ,
Industrial Designer: Well it's very expensive .
Project Manager: because it's not that important .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
User Interface: Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa
Project Manager: Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .
User Interface: yeah . The number of uh {disfmarker} yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager: Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would {disfmarker}
User Interface: And and does it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature ,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price .
User Interface: But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?
Project Manager: Twenty five Euros .
User Interface: Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: But even now , if only our production costs w {vocalsound} uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was {disfmarker} were t uh was twenty two ?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: M about fifty Euros .
User Interface: yeah .
Industrial Designer: That's quite ex
User Interface: That's price , but w w
Industrial Designer: well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
User Interface: No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .
User Interface: Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .
Project Manager: Bu but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .
Industrial Designer: Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition
Project Manager: {gap} .
Industrial Designer: and this one does .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So I think it's worth its price .
Project Manager: Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} with these ratings uh
Project Manager: That's counting .
Industrial Designer: Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .
Marketing: should be about one point s seven ,
User Interface: Four six seven eight .
Marketing: yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Project Manager: Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um {disfmarker} What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Try to translate that . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Any any other {disfmarker} Uh , Roo ?
User Interface: Yeah , I think uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well , I think {disfmarker}
Marketing: Ye
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Roo . {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} The process was good .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made
Industrial Designer: Mm . Actually , we had {disfmarker}
User Interface: the the choice between {gap} what {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Better decision .
Industrial Designer: Yes .
User Interface: yeah .
Industrial Designer: We had we had too little information actually .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker} And uh um the the the {disfmarker} well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too {disfmarker} the the choice of components was way too narrow .
Project Manager: Less . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: So there was not really a process of uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So we could we we could be {disfmarker} we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
Industrial Designer: Well {disfmarker} Yes .
Marketing: The prices .

Summarize the discussion about the evaluation criteria.|Marketing set the criteria for evaluation. The group gave two points on the fancy look and feel, three points on the ease of use and learnable, and two points on technological innovation because the group thought new features were not all extraordinary. Besides, they gave two points on the target market trend which said that the products with fruit and vegetables in different colors might be popular. Lastly, they gave high marks on the room for creativity and leadership.|"['Marketing: Mm {vocalsound} most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .', 'Industrial Designer: Yeah , those memory functions .', 'Marketing: But uh not not every every television , so {disfmarker}', 'Industrial Designer: Yeah .', ""Project Manager: Okay , it's cool ."", 'Industrial Designer: Was uh this logo for uh volume ?', ""Project Manager: Yeah , that's fine ."", ""Industrial Designer: Okay .

Marketing: Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: In the bottom .
Marketing: Oh .
Project Manager: Look-and-feel ?
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: No , evaluation is {disfmarker}
Marketing: Evaluation crit Yeah , evaluation presentation . It's not in . Uh d it doesn't matter um {disfmarker} It only had two pages or something . {vocalsound} Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . The Italians uh , how they think about it . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: um {vocalsound} model .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: And this {disfmarker} These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um {vocalsound} we have to discuss about {vocalsound} , if we give it a one or a seven .
Project Manager: Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful .
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yes .
Project Manager: We are actu We are the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm .
Marketing: Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and {vocalsound} and that kind of stuff .
Project Manager: Flashy .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Well I think we do {disfmarker}
Marketing: The LEDs .
User Interface: If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .
Marketing: Yes .
Project Manager: But uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ?
Project Manager: Yeah , just only {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} Yeah , that's how I think .
User Interface: Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so {disfmarker}
Marketing: So I'll give it a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Ye
Marketing: Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah , this {disfmarker} It is a one .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: It's okay . It's cool .
Marketing: I think it's one . Okay , next .
Project Manager: This is a difficult one , because we we don't {disfmarker} Yeah , we don't know it about the {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Uh {vocalsound} it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: It's {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: No , but you don't have to use that .
Marketing: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .
Project Manager: No .
Industrial Designer: That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .
User Interface: So I think it's easy to use , but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker}
Marketing: Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .
Industrial Designer: Well , I think it is .
Marketing: Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .
User Interface: Well y just uh f
Marketing: I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or
Project Manager: But the rest of it is very easy ,
Marketing: {disfmarker} Uh then the re
Project Manager: because there are so so n
Industrial Designer: So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .
User Interface: Yes .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use .
Marketing: Okay .
User Interface: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .
Marketing: Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ?
User Interface: Device .
Marketing: And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls .
Project Manager: But {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing: 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um {vocalsound} easy to use .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Because easy to use comes after learnable .
Project Manager: Okay , just {disfmarker} Easy to use is very cool ,
Marketing: I I think it a three or something .
Project Manager: so just give it a two .
User Interface: Maybe three then . Learnable's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .
Industrial Designer: Mm uh . The normal .
User Interface: Yeah okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yep , true . Then a two .
Marketing: Oh . Okay .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing: New features . Techno technological innovative ?
Industrial Designer: The speech function and the colour . Colour .
Marketing: {vocalsound} The speech function is new .
User Interface: And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .

What did Marketing recommend to do when discussing the evaluation criteria of market trend?|Project Manager thought they should skip the speaker when User Interface mentioned the power indicator. Marketing recommended that they need a button to beep for calling and they should include the speaker because it was usable and small enough. Also, Marketing supplemented that the production cost has been considered and within 12.3 Euros.|"['Marketing: Mm {vocalsound} most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .', 'Industrial Designer: Yeah , those memory functions .', 'Marketing: But uh not not every every television , so {disfmarker}', 'Industrial Designer: Yeah .', ""Project Manager: Okay , it's cool ."", 'Industrial Designer: Was uh this logo for uh volume ?', ""Project Manager: Yeah , that's fine ."", ""Industrial Designer: Okay .

Marketing: Yes . Yeah , but did we reach , um {vocalsound} with our uh style , the targeted audience ?
Project Manager: I think so , yeah .
Marketing: Th that's my question .
Project Manager: You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: So you want {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So
User Interface: Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker .

User Interface: We had to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm hmm yeah .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah , finance .
Industrial Designer: So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: But the teamwork was okay .
Marketing: Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: I think uh everyone listen to each other .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design .
Project Manager: Yeah . 'Kay . Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work .
User Interface: It was {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Just doesn't work .
Project Manager: No .
User Interface: Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well .
Marketing: Digital pen or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap} Yeah .
User Interface: Just not work too slow .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great .
Marketing: Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think .
User Interface: Yeah , more accurate . Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Precise .
User Interface: And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Not just pointing out on it .
Project Manager: It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: And so you've {disfmarker}
User Interface: No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down .
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Yeah ,
Industrial Designer: But you might as well do it in normal computer style .
Project Manager: like {gap} .
User Interface: Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . And it's far too slow this way .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function .
Industrial Designer: No .
Project Manager: {gap} I think {disfmarker} Yeah , okay .
Marketing: Digital pen .
Project Manager: So we made it in time . {vocalsound} And we made a remote control .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} We did it .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: In the budget , yeah .
User Interface: New ideas found .
Marketing: New ideas .
User Interface: Oh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: What's that ?
Marketing: For for for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I don't know what it mean . Just {disfmarker}
User Interface: I just think if we uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: For remote control probably .
User Interface: I dunno .
Project Manager: No , for the project . {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: For remote control , a favourite for your text .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
Marketing: No , for the prototype . New ideas .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah . But it's for the next team . We don't have to do that .

What did the group discuss about how much employers understood the meaning of Welsh bac?|They all agreed that most employers did not have a clear understanding of what Welsh bac means or what it includes, which was a big problem not only for employers, but also for parents and young people. Though some small engaged employers did understand it, the vast majority focused more on running the business without a clear understanding.|"['Sian Gwenllian AM: Which is a big problem.', ""Dafydd Evans: Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course."", ""Dr Rachel Bowen: And I think that that varies by size of employer as well. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. But we know that most employers in Wales are small or microbusinesses. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine."", ""Nick Brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues\xa0within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly\xa0meet with—employers—and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require—the Welsh bac—to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within\xa0those professional sectors. Not many of them have indicated that the Welsh bac is providing the skills that they require. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac\xa0initially, but the Welsh bac\xa0has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the\xa0year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable.

But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. They are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway.

What did Ed Evans (director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association) think about employers' understanding of Welsh bac?|Ed Evans thought employers did not understand it, but they would appreciate it if they do. This was particularly true for his own sector, the civil engineering sector, and particularly contracting sector. Because pupils usually did not have a very strong academic background in this sector, and Welsh bac gave them the opportunity to not pursue that much of academic, but tested them in terms of the challenges. Therefore, the growth of the Welsh bac would be valued at least for this sector.|"[""Kay Martin: Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications.\xa0But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they\xa0want them to be literate, numerate, and they want them to have digital skills. And that isn't captured necessarily in the Welsh baccalaureate. And, so, the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with."", ""Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And, finally, I know you've got strong views as an organisation."", 'Ed Evans: Do you mind if I carry on in English—', 'Sian Gwenllian AM: Fine.', ""Ed Evans: —just so that a lot of our members will understand when I'm speaking. I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this.

Kay Martin: Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications. But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be literate, numerate, and they want them to have digital skills. And that isn't captured necessarily in the Welsh baccalaureate. And, so, the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with.

What did they decide on how to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac?|They proposed that the voice of employers should be a key part of reviewing the qualification. Instead of colleges or qualifications boards doing this, employers themselves should do this qualification, which accorded to the vision of the Welsh baccalaureate, to improve skills for employment. They really should join employers and schools and education facilities together more in the future.|"['Sian Gwenllian AM: Which is a big problem.', ""Dafydd Evans: Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course."", ""Dr Rachel Bowen: And I think that that varies by size of employer as well. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. But we know that most employers in Wales are small or microbusinesses. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine."", ""Nick Brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues\xa0within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly\xa0meet with—employers—and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require—the Welsh bac—to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within\xa0those professional sectors. Not many of them have indicated that the Welsh bac is providing the skills that they require. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac\xa0initially, but the Welsh bac\xa0has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the\xa0year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And, as I said, from the employer boards that we have, very few of them understand\xa0the Welsh bac.

Summarize the views about how well the Welsh bac helped to prepare learners for employment.|One thing needing to be cleared was that Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications, but not just one qualification. To develop the employability skills was obviously a key part of it, but not all of it. It obviously worked well to help prepare for employment, but was not for everyone, because some people had to do the other things. It helped prepare some people, such as the A level students for university, but did not help health and social care people become more skilled and employable.|"[""Nick Brazil: I think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac—I think when we go back a number of years—was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. And that's what happens, unfortunately. But I think what Ed said is absolutely right: if you get the engagement of the employers—. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. The actual progress of learners into employment is happening. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. The vision was a good one."", ""Dafydd Evans: I'd like to expand on what Nick said. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't. So, yes, there are options out there, but because we're so focused on qualifications and we will only fund qualifications, that drives certain behaviours, and\xa0I think you need as a committee to be very much aware of that."", 'Suzy Davies AM: Yes, but that was very useful information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\xa0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools—well, and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it.

And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs—in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a\xa0C grade in the core subjects. But that eats into the time that we have to teach young people. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow—no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. So, the priorities, I think, across the sector—. We've given priority to GCSE\xa0resits\xa0rather than doing the Welsh bac\xa0at present.

But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac—for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well—that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes—and we all get funded on the outcomes—that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability.

Meeting Transcript:
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and there is no substitute. Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2, then, is a further evidence session, number four, on our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Dafydd Evans, who is chair, ColegauCymru, and chief executive officer of Grŵp Llandrillo Menai; Kay Martin, principal of Cardiff and Vale College, also representing ColegauCymru; Nick Brazil, who is deputy principal, Gower College Swansea, also representing ColegauCymru; Dr Rachel Bowen, director of policy and development at ColegauCymru; and Ed Evans, who is the director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association. Thank you all for attending. We're very pleased that you've been able to join us. If it's okay with you, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Siân Gwenllian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Good morning. I'll be asking my questions in Welsh.
Nick Brazil: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification—it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac—for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well—that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes—and we all get funded on the outcomes—that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. So, I think people lose the fact that the Welsh bac is a combination of things. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh—I thought that's something that we need to think about.
Kay Martin: If I could just say as well, our job in the college is to develop skills and employable people, and we use every tool in our box to do that. And, as I said earlier, there are lots of things that we do. The Welsh bac, where it works really well, does help prepare them, I think, for employment, but it's not for everyone, because some people have to do the other things.

So, I think it needs to be reviewed, to look at how we could make skilled and employable people. It helps prepare some people—the A-level students for university—but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.
Kay Martin: No, it isn't used. In the majority of colleges across Wales, it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool, because most of us, as you see, we value the Welsh bac. We'd like some changes to the Welsh bac, but we value the Welsh bac in many cases. So, we wouldn't deliberately—. I mean, if a course in my college doesn't want to do the Welsh bac, they have to come and give me evidence about why they don't think it's fit and what they're going to do in place of it. So, we don't deliberately tell people, 'Come on in and you won't have to do it.'
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, can I run that across you all, in an outburst of honesty?
Dafydd Evans: Yes, absolutely. We universally adopt at level 3, but we don't at levels 1 and 2.
Suzy Davies AM: Oh, yes, for the reasons you've given in the evidence, actually.
Dafydd Evans: Yes, but across the whole of level 3, A-level and vocational, the Welsh bac is an integral part of the curriculum, and it isn't an option for the student to opt out.
Lynne Neagle AM: Do you let your Seren students opt out like they do in Cardiff and the Vale, or do they have to do it as well?
Dafydd Evans: We've forced—. No, sorry, 'forced' is not the word. [Laughter.] We have encouraged and persuaded everybody to do it.
Suzy Davies AM: So, that will be four A-levels plus bac.

Summarize Dafydd Evans' (chair of ColegauCymru) and Nick Brazil's (deputy principal) opinion on how well the Welsh bac helped to prepare for employment?|Dafydd Evans though that one of the problems was that there were a number of priorities. For example, there were a number of students who needed to resit their GCSE. It was important for everybody to get a C grade in those core subjects, but that would take some time from them teaching young people. Therefore, there were fewer and fewer doing level 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they were resitting their GCSEs. Nick Brazil added that Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications, and developing the employment was one of the key parts, but not all of it.|"[""Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone.

It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. And that's what happens, unfortunately. But I think what Ed said is absolutely right: if you get the engagement of the employers—. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. The actual progress of learners into employment is happening. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. The vision was a good one."", ""Dafydd Evans: I'd like to expand on what Nick said. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't.

Summarize the views to what extent they believe that universities understood the value of the Welsh bac.|They thought most universities did not understand, based on some experience they had with some of their learners that went to Russell Group universities. But this depended on the admission tutors and the areas that they were going. Some areas valued it more, but some others did not.|"[""Nick Brazil: I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us—certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners—that a number of them have come from school and\xa0probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs.

Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a\xa0low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. But I think it's questionable, certainly at national and foundation. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.'

Meeting Transcript:
Nick Brazil: I think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac—I think when we go back a number of years—was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. And that's what happens, unfortunately. But I think what Ed said is absolutely right: if you get the engagement of the employers—. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. The actual progress of learners into employment is happening. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. The vision was a good one.
Dafydd Evans: I'd like to expand on what Nick said. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't. So, yes, there are options out there, but because we're so focused on qualifications and we will only fund qualifications, that drives certain behaviours, and I think you need as a committee to be very much aware of that.
Nick Brazil: I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us—certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners—that a number of them have come from school and probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs. Okay, they've come to us, they're trying to build themselves back up, build their skills back up, and adding another qualification on top, adding the Welsh bac on top, whether that's foundation or national, on top of what they have to do, which is a programme they've come and decided to do—think of the pressure that increases upon them. Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. But I think it's questionable, certainly at national and foundation. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels.
Dr Rachel Bowen: And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college.
Nick Brazil: Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. So, obviously, we've had that track record.

What was the situation in north Wales when discussing to what extent that universities understood the value of the Welsh bac?|Welsh universities were much more willing to recognize the bac. Therefore, it was not a huge problem there. However, students who were looking to go out to universities in England encountered some problems. But in terms of Bangor and Glyndŵr University, there was no problem.|"['Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.

By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then—'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well."", ""Kay Martin: Many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges,\xa0but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university.

At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up to a Russell university's expectations, and on the other hand, it's trying to develop softer skills and employment skills for people going into work from a vocational area. Can the same product deliver those two outcomes?

But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. They are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway.

What did Dafydd Evans (chair of ColegauCymru) think of introducing a specialist teacher training qualification?|Dafydd Evans thought that if it were going to be a success, it would be contextualised. For the vocational lecturers to do that, they had to invest heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac.

Meeting Transcript:
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and there is no substitute. Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2, then, is a further evidence session, number four, on our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Dafydd Evans, who is chair, ColegauCymru, and chief executive officer of Grŵp Llandrillo Menai; Kay Martin, principal of Cardiff and Vale College, also representing ColegauCymru; Nick Brazil, who is deputy principal, Gower College Swansea, also representing ColegauCymru; Dr Rachel Bowen, director of policy and development at ColegauCymru; and Ed Evans, who is the director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association. Thank you all for attending. We're very pleased that you've been able to join us. If it's okay with you, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Siân Gwenllian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Good morning. I'll be asking my questions in Welsh.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied? ColegauCymru said that learners may have had a negative experience of the Welsh bac in previous study.
Dafydd Evans: That's been a new dimension lately, I think, in that, when the Welsh bac first hit FE, we were leading the way—
Kay Martin: Great advocates.
Dafydd Evans: —and great advocates. By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then—'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well.
Kay Martin: Many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges, but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities, four A-levels is better. But in most colleges that have A-level students it's almost compulsory to do the Welsh bac as well, but normally that would be three A-levels and the Welsh bac—normally.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. And then ColegauCymru say that, increasingly, the Welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. So, are the different levels of the Welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals?
Nick Brazil: Yes.
Kay Martin: Yes.
Dafydd Evans: Yes.
Dr Rachel Bowen: Yes.
Dr Rachel Bowen: It does make it into quite an intensive selling process for colleges when they've got to overcome that negative perception. As people have said already, it is possible to talk parents and learners round, but then that's time spent having to do that selling job when we should be talking about other things.
Kay Martin: Can I just mention as well that there's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not A-levels? Perhaps you might want to do an engineering BTEC programme, or you might want to do a health and social care, or you might want to do hospitality. You might want to do BTEC programmes, you can still go to university if that's what you want to do, or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards, and selling that whole range to parents, because there is an overemphasis, by us all, on A-levels—.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that?

What did Nick Brazil (deputy principal) think of introducing a specialist teacher training qualification?|Nick Brazil thought the number of the skills and the number of challenges that were done within the Welsh bac were done very similarly within the vocational qualification. Therefore, a number of those staff had already got those skills and they had undertaken that.|"['Suzy Davies AM: Yes, but that was very useful information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\xa0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools—well, and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it. So, thank you for that. Diolch.', 'Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Have you finished? Janet.', ""Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Good morning. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective—."", ""Dafydd Evans: I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs—in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a\xa0C grade in the core subjects. But that eats into the time that we have to teach young people. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow—no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. So, the priorities, I think, across the sector—. We've given priority to GCSE\xa0resits\xa0rather than doing the Welsh bac\xa0at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3."", ""Nick Brazil: Yes, I know, I totally understand, but it's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners. If you don't offer the full range, which, sometimes—if you, obviously, limit and you make qualifications compulsory, that can limit the choice of opportunities as well. So, I think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options. There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now, where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra—Welsh bac. So, for example, modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in Wales, and, I think, I picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is, 'We have to put our focus on the Welsh bac\xa0to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language.'"", ""Sian Gwenllian AM: But it could be a short-sighted view because what some young people tell us is that at the time—and parents—they didn't really appreciate what skills they were actually learning, and by the time they'd got into employment, that working as a team, the communication skills, they thought, 'Ah, we\xa0did—. I know what this is about', and it all makes sense at that point. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run."", ""Lynne Neagle AM: Okay.

What did the group talk about the conceptual design of the remote control, including the functions and some possible advanced techniques?|In order to make a satisfying profit, the group had to set their price at 25 euros, which was relatively high. For fear that the higher price would lead to fewer consumers, they decided to make it a universal remote control, being able to function on different TVs.

Project Manager: Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control

Marketing: if we {disfmarker}
User Interface: 'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker}
Marketing: You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,
Project Manager: Yeah
Marketing: but it's very hard to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .
User Interface: Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .
Marketing: Nah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: so you can do something unique with that .
Industrial Designer: And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .
Marketing: Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .
Project Manager: Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .

Meeting Transcript:
User Interface: Yes that one .
Project Manager: This one ?
User Interface: Yes .
Marketing: Press F_ eleven .
Project Manager: Ah cool . Okay . So
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: that's my name , {gap} . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to {disfmarker} uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . So um the {gap} thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things {disfmarker} or , not yet ,
User Interface: Yes .
Project Manager: okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly {gap} that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it {disfmarker} that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for {disfmarker} what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} uh no , this is a {disfmarker} these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . And you already saw {disfmarker} you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
Marketing: Folder ,
Project Manager: Folder , okay .
Marketing: yes .
Project Manager: So no okay {gap} have a look at that one . Okay . So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read . {vocalsound} You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard
Marketing: So I {disfmarker}
Project Manager: it's not mm {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , it probably would be universal .
User Interface: Universal .
Marketing: Because {disfmarker} {gap}
User Interface: And only television ? Or more devices ?
Project Manager: I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so {disfmarker} not sure , but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm , maybe , I don't know .
Marketing: Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros
Project Manager: Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect .
User Interface: Ah okay .
Marketing: Yeah , I think .
Industrial Designer: And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player
Project Manager: Yeah , everything
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: just {disfmarker} so a lot of buttons {vocalsound} on the remote control .
Industrial Designer: okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , probably .
User Interface: Not just a T_V_ .
Project Manager: No , just everything .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: {gap} . so yeah ,
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not {disfmarker} nothing very special , but um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well we can try to make it special .
Project Manager: yeah , that's right .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , or you c
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .
Marketing: Oh that's good , yeah .
User Interface: Yeah b I wanted {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh maybe be uh it's it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: There are buttons on it .
User Interface: No you can make an uh manual in it .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .
Project Manager: Okay . But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .
User Interface: But that's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh like a a to have {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah , but
User Interface: Yeah , I think it's much uh {disfmarker} too expensive .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , maybe it would .
Marketing: Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen .
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Marketing: because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .
Project Manager: Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .
User Interface: Yeah , too fragile .
Marketing: Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Kid-proof .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {gap} .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ?
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh should you put it in a recharger or a {disfmarker} just {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh maybe that's a good idea ,
Marketing: Ma maybe a home station .
Project Manager: just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: you never have to use any batteries .

Why did the Marketing disagree with the Industrial Design when discussing the possible advanced techniques on the remote control?|When discussing adding several advanced techniques onto the remote control to make it more unique, the Industrial Design put forward to using the touchscreen. Notwithstanding the merits of the touchscreen, for instance, a touch screen would make the remote control easier and smaller, the Marketing did not agree to do so just because in that case they would be beyond the budget.|"['Marketing: So I {disfmarker}', ""Project Manager: it's not mm {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}"", 'Industrial Designer: Yeah , it probably would be universal .', 'User Interface: Universal .', 'Marketing: Because {disfmarker} {gap}', 'User Interface: And only television ?

Marketing: You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,
Project Manager: Yeah

Industrial Designer: N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .
User Interface: Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .
Marketing: Nah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: so you can do something unique with that .
Industrial Designer: And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .
Marketing: Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .
Project Manager: Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .

What did Industrial Design suggest to do when discussing the conceptual design of the remote control?|When discussing the conceptual design of the remote control, the group noticed that the energy source was also a problem worth concern. The Industrial Design proposed to make it rechargeable at first, but because of their limited budget, he had to change his idea. The Industrial Design then put forward to setting a station at home or perhaps just using normal batteries to run the remote control, both of which would be feasible.|"['Industrial Designer: Yeah , or you c', 'Project Manager: Yeah .', 'Industrial Designer: O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .', ""Marketing: Oh that's good , yeah ."", 'User Interface: Yeah b I wanted {disfmarker}', 'Marketing: Yeah .', 'Project Manager: Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?', ""Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh maybe be uh it's it's {disfmarker}"", 'Project Manager: There are buttons on it .', 'User Interface: No you can make an uh manual in it .', 'Industrial Designer: Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .', ""Project Manager: Okay .

Project Manager: Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .
User Interface: Yeah , too fragile .
Marketing: Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Kid-proof .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {gap} .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ?
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh should you put it in a recharger or a {disfmarker} just {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh maybe that's a good idea ,
Marketing: Ma maybe a home station .
Project Manager: just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: you never have to use any batteries .
Marketing: you you have to uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control
Marketing: Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know
Project Manager: or {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well I think we have to look at that ,
Marketing: if we {disfmarker}
User Interface: 'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker}
Marketing: You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,
Project Manager: Yeah
Marketing: but it's very hard to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .
User Interface: Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .
Marketing: Nah .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: so you can do something unique with that .
Industrial Designer: And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .
Marketing: Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .
Project Manager: Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,
Industrial Designer: But n {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah , yeah .
Industrial Designer: yeah , but uh i {vocalsound} basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,
Marketing: and if you fold it open {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But maybe it's
User Interface: What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control .
Project Manager: Yeah , it's alright .
User Interface: I already wrote some down , some ideas .
Marketing: Yep .
Project Manager: Yeah , just {disfmarker} is that okay ?
User Interface: Yep .
Marketing: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: There's already a document in the folder about it .
Marketing: Yeah , me too .
Project Manager: So see you in thirty minutes .
User Interface: Okay .
Marketing: Okay , well done .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so {disfmarker} your laptop .
User Interface: I will .
Marketing: Oh Paul . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It didn't say that .
Project Manager: No , sorry .
User Interface: Your fault .
Marketing: Ciao .

Summarize the button layout, the shape and the appearance of the remote control.|The User Interface drew a draft for the group to get a more direct idea about the button layout. Through a brief discussion, they agreed that as long as they made the button clear enough to be recognized, it would not matter much where the exact button was. The group also thought about a remote control which was able to be folded, in order to test if it would be strong enough to stand hit.|"['User Interface: Yes that one .', 'Project Manager: This one ?', 'User Interface: Yes .', 'Marketing: Press F_ eleven .', 'Project Manager: Ah cool .

Summarize the discussion about microphone issues|The professor pointed out that the lapel microphones were too close, so they were not good representative microphones. There was strong agreement that mics capture breath and other non-voice sounds since they were common.|"['Professor C: I mean we \'ve had these discussions before , and {disfmarker} and one of the things that struck me was that {disfmarker} uh , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um {disfmarker} whenever you condense things , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you throw away some information . And , that \'s mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it , because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular , uh , phonetic units . Um , but , you \'ll do throw something away . And so the question is , uh , can we figure out if there \'s something we \'ve thrown away that we shouldn\'t have . And um . So , when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking "" oh , OK , so they \'re picking on something they \'re looking on it to figure out noise , or voice {disfmarker} voiced property whatever .

Meeting Transcript:
Professor C: I mean we 've had these discussions before , and {disfmarker} and one of the things that struck me was that {disfmarker} uh , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um {disfmarker} whenever you condense things , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you throw away some information . And , that 's mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it , because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular , uh , phonetic units . Um , but , you 'll do throw something away . And so the question is , uh , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have . And um . So , when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking "" oh , OK , so they 're picking on something they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice {disfmarker} voiced property whatever . "" So that {disfmarker} that 's interesting . Maybe that helps to drive the {disfmarker} the thought process of coming up with the features . But for me sort of the interesting thing was , "" well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? "" So another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the FFT uh , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network ,
PhD B: To know {disfmarker}
Professor C: and then use it , you know , in combination , or alone , or {disfmarker} or whatever
PhD F: Wi - with what targets ?
PhD A: Voiced , unvoiced is like {disfmarker}
Professor C: Uh , no .
PhD A: Oh . Or anything .
Professor C: No the {disfmarker} just the same {disfmarker} same way we 're using {disfmarker} I mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank .
PhD F: Phones .
PhD A: Oh , OK .
Professor C: Exact way {disfmarker} the same way we 're using the filter bank .
Professor C: I mean , the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it 's good . But it 's different . And , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing . And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or uh , um , adding probabilities , I mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the {disfmarker} essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here .
PhD D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
PhD A: Mm - hmm .
PhD D: Yeah , but there is so much variability in the power spectrum .

Summarize the discussion about spectral subtraction|The team was doing spectral subtraction with both scaling and GGT bins. There were pros and cons to both approaches. The professor suggested a simple spectral subtraction followed by a KL transformation. He also suggested using JRASTRA's technique which relied on adding some noise to get rid of noise.

PhD F: It 's {disfmarker} it 's not guaranteed though .
PhD A: Yeah .
Professor C: Uh , it 's not guaranteed .
PhD A: Yeah .
Professor C: Right .
PhD D: Mm - hmm .
PhD A: Yeah because the m the main {disfmarker} major reason for the m
Professor C: Right .
PhD A: the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually .
Professor C: Again , if you have enough {disfmarker} if you have enough {disfmarker}
PhD A: No yeah , yeah . Yeah .
Professor C: So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK , so you {disfmarker} much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you {disfmarker} you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and {disfmarker} and record noise conditions , or something , and then {disfmarker} I don't think that 's very realistic , I mean I th
PhD A: Mm - hmm .
Professor C: I {disfmarker} I you know , so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} you know , I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially , that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars , and {disfmarker} and you would have something that was roughly similar and maybe that 's the argument , but I 'm not sure I buy it , so .
PhD A: Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Professor C: Uh , So What else is going on ?
PhD D: Mmm . You Yeah . We are playing {disfmarker} we are also playing , trying to put other spectral subtraction mmm , in the code . Um , it would be a very simple spectral subtraction , on the um , mel energies which I already tested but without the um frame dropping actually , and I think it 's important to have frame dropping if you use spectral subtraction .
PhD F: Is it {disfmarker} is spectral subtraction typically done on the {disfmarker} after the mel , uh , scaling or is it done on the FFT bins ?
Professor C: I see . So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a
PhD A: Wiener filtering . It 's a {disfmarker} it 's a cascade of two s
Professor C: Wiener filter . Yeah , in general , you don't {disfmarker} that 's right you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy . Actually . Um , that was something that uh , Herve and I were talking about with um , the multi - band stuff , that if you 're converting things to from uh , bands , groups of bands into cepstral coef you know , local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it 's not that great to do it if it 's noisy .
PhD A: Mm - hmm . OK . Yeah . So .
Professor C: Uh , so .
PhD A: So that {disfmarker} that 's one reason maybe we could combine s some {disfmarker} something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage ,
Professor C: Yeah .
PhD A: and then do a something in the second stage which could take it further .
PhD D: What was your point about {disfmarker} about colored noise there ?
PhD A: Oh , the colored noise uh {disfmarker}
PhD D: Yeah .
PhD A: the colored noise {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the v the signal subspace approach has {disfmarker} I mean , it {disfmarker} it actually depends on inverting the matrices . So it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} ac the covariance matrix of the noise . So if {disfmarker} if it is not positive definite ,
PhD D: Mm - hmm .
PhD A: I mean it has a {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite .
Professor C: So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise .
PhD A: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , first of the colo colored noise
Professor C: Yeah .
PhD A: and then make the noise white ,
Professor C: week and a half , uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans . Um . You know .

PhD D: Mm - hmm .
Professor C: and then , you know , uh , but , w um , uh , he 'll have some ideas on that too .
PhD A: The other thing is to , uh {disfmarker} Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks . But we {disfmarker} we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage , which is also going to be a noisy task so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all .

PhD D: So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing
PhD A: Yeah . That 's what
Professor C: Well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing .
PhD D: and {disfmarker} Yeah .
Professor C: I mean maybe one or {disfmarker} one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first .
PhD A: That 's wh Yeah . So ,
Professor C: Right , so he 's doing a signal subspace thing , maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction , or maybe vi maybe the other way around ,
PhD D: Yeah , mm - hmm .
PhD A: Yeah .
Professor C: you know ?
PhD A: So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace ,
PhD D: Mm - hmm .
PhD A: I mean just to see all {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not .
PhD D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah .
Professor C: How is it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I guess I 'm ignorant about this , how does {disfmarker} I mean , since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're {disfmarker} that you 're adding together the two signals , how is {disfmarker} how is that differ from signal subspace ?
PhD A: The signal subspace ? The {disfmarker}
Professor C: Yeah .
PhD A: The signal subspace approach has actually an in - built Wiener filtering in it .
Professor C: Oh , OK .
PhD A: Yeah . It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter . Is the signal is {disfmarker} is a signal substrate .
Professor C: Oh , oh , OK so the difference is the KL .
Professor C: I see . So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a
PhD A: Wiener filtering . It 's a {disfmarker} it 's a cascade of two s
Professor C: Wiener filter . Yeah , in general , you don't {disfmarker} that 's right you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy . Actually .

PhD A: So that {disfmarker} that 's one reason maybe we could combine s some {disfmarker} something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage ,

Professor C: week and a half , uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans . Um . You know . So , I mean one way would {disfmarker} he Here are some alternate visions . I mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same {disfmarker} different aspects of the same thing . Another thing would be to have t to {disfmarker} to pick two pol two plausible things , and {disfmarker} and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better ,
PhD D: Mm - hmm .
Professor C: and then , you know , uh , but , w um , uh , he 'll have some ideas on that too .
PhD A: The other thing is to , uh {disfmarker} Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks . But we {disfmarker} we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage , which is also going to be a noisy task so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all . So , there are some {disfmarker} I mean , I was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks and spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks . And it 's {disfmarker} Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere . But if we {disfmarker} if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization {pause} to make it work @ @ .
Professor C: So they 're making {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} Somebody 's generating Wall Street Journal with additive {disfmarker} artificially added noise or something ?
PhD A: Yeah , yeah .
Professor C: Sort of a {disfmarker} sort of like what they did with TI - digits , and ?
PhD A: Yeah . Yeah .
Professor C: Yeah , OK .
PhD A: I m I guess Guenter Hirsch is in charge of that . Guenter Hirsch and TI .
Professor C: OK .


Question: What did the professor think about the Wiener filter?

Meeting Transcript:
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ?
Industrial Designer: That's correct .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .
User Interface: Alright .
Industrial Designer: Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?
Project Manager: There is ? Yeah , there is .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No problem .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . {vocalsound} Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: The market , we should have a look at the market . Um {vocalsound} we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the {gap} {disfmarker} the the progressions , yes .
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
Industrial Designer: Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
Project Manager: Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,
Industrial Designer: Yes ,
Project Manager: and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,
Project Manager: Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .
Project Manager: Okay . Okay , good .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ? Okay , okay .
Industrial Designer: That's it .
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} okay . Great . Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation . Um {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
User Interface: Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .
Industrial Designer: Yes , I think it should be something like that .
User Interface: It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,
Project Manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,
User Interface: right ?
Project Manager: not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it .
Industrial Designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?
Project Manager: No . No .
Industrial Designer: No ,
User Interface: No , okay .
Industrial Designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?
Marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .
Project Manager: Okay . Okay .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session . Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: It just should change the T_V_'s state .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: So that's it . Um but furthermore {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?

Meeting Transcript:
Industrial Designer: influations influences .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Okay , great .
Industrial Designer: Okay ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . {vocalsound} Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but {disfmarker} well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .
User Interface: And for a cell phone ?
Industrial Designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
User Interface: Yeah , okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .
User Interface: But {disfmarker} Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so
Industrial Designer: But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all .
User Interface: y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them .
Industrial Designer: So that's the point .
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
Industrial Designer: Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
Project Manager: Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,
Industrial Designer: Yes ,
Project Manager: and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,
Project Manager: Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .
Project Manager: Okay . Okay , good .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ? Okay , okay .
Industrial Designer: That's it .
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} okay . Great . Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation . Um {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
User Interface: Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .
Industrial Designer: Yes , I think it should be something like that .
User Interface: It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,
Project Manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,
User Interface: right ?
Project Manager: not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it .
Industrial Designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?
Project Manager: No . No .
Industrial Designer: No ,
User Interface: No , okay .
Industrial Designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?
Marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .
Project Manager: Okay . Okay .
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function .
Project Manager: Yeah .
User Interface: So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session . Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: It just should change the T_V_'s state .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: So that's it . Um but furthermore {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?

What did the group discuss about the connection of remote control and TV?|Industrial Designer pointed out that infrared connection is old-fashioned so they should choose a novel one, such as Bluetooth.

Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . {vocalsound} Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: The market , we should have a look at the market . Um {vocalsound} we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the {gap} {disfmarker} the the progressions , yes .
Industrial Designer: influations influences .
Project Manager: Okay .
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Okay , great .
Industrial Designer: Okay ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . {vocalsound} Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but {disfmarker} well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .
User Interface: And for a cell phone ?
Industrial Designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
User Interface: Yeah , okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer: I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .
User Interface: But {disfmarker} Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so
Industrial Designer: But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all .
User Interface: y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them .
Industrial Designer: So that's the point .
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
Industrial Designer: Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss
User Interface: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,
Project Manager: Yeah .
Industrial Designer: but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
Project Manager: Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,
Industrial Designer: Yes ,
Project Manager: and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,
Project Manager: Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .
Project Manager: Okay . Okay , good .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ? Okay , okay .
Industrial Designer: That's it .
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} okay . Great . Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation . Um {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
User Interface: Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?

Meeting Transcript:
Professor E: Alright .
Grad C: So are you {disfmarker}
Professor E: So .
Grad C: Are we going ?
Professor E: It is uh , must be February fifteenth .
Postdoc F: Yeah .
Grad C: Yu I think the date 's written in there , yep . And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to "" Session "" , and write MR eleven .
Professor E: Yeah . Yeah . We didn't have a front - end meeting today .
Grad C: And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's {comment} gets marked as unread , unused .
Professor E: OK .
PhD A: MR eleven .
Grad C: MR eleven .
Postdoc F: That sounds like a spy code .
Professor E: Mmm . OK . So .
Grad C: There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work {pause} correctly .
Professor E: Agenda . Any agenda items today ?
Grad C: I wanna talk a little bit about getting {disfmarker} how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to {disfmarker} how to finish it up .
Professor E: OK .
Postdoc F: I wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the {pause} um {pause} well some of the equipment . In particular , the {disfmarker} well uh , that 's just what I wanna ask .
Professor E: OK audio monitoring , Jane .
Postdoc F: Ba - based on some of the tran uh {disfmarker} i In listening to {pause} some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact {disfmarker} in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of {disfmarker} of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings ,
Grad C: Oh really .
Postdoc F: so I {disfmarker}
PhD B: "" Spikes "" , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or {disfmarker} ?
Postdoc F: Mm - hmm . Yeah .
PhD A: Spikes ?
Grad C: Clicks .
Postdoc F: Yeah .
Professor E: Hmm .
Grad C: and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless . Another wireless setup . I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired .
Professor E: So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?
Grad C: Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes .
Professor E: So , um .
Grad C: And {disfmarker} So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six .
Professor E: So let 's see we {disfmarker}
Grad C: Right ? So we could have up to nine .
Professor E: And right now we can have up to six .
Grad C: Right . And we have five , we 're getting one more .
Professor E: Yeah .
Grad C: And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel .
Professor E: Oh . So yeah so the only {disfmarker} Beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars .
Grad C: Right .
Professor E: Oh , we should do it .
Grad C: OK . OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them .
Professor E: Yeah . Yeah .
PhD B: I don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . If {disfmarker} So we 're not increasing the number of channels . OK .
Grad C: No , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working ,
PhD B: OK . I see .
Grad C: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless .
Professor E: Yeah .
PhD B: Three wireds work ,
Postdoc F: The {disfmarker} I agree that the consent forms were {disfmarker} uh , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that {vocalsound} um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them .
Professor E: I see . OK , well , if that 's what it said .
Postdoc F: And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that {vocalsound} uh , we wouldn't want someone to say "" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but {vocalsound} it was too hard to access "" . So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it . Now {disfmarker} in terms of like editing it by hand , I mean I think it 's {disfmarker} i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited . But {disfmarker} but it seems to me that sometimes um , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice {disfmarker} it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK .
Grad C: I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it . Um .
Professor E: Um {pause} I mean it 's also a mixture of people , I mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not .
Grad C: Yep .
Professor E: Others would consider it {disfmarker} this uh {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a set of skills that they would have to gain . You know ?
Grad C: Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former .
Professor E: It depends on what meetings .
Postdoc F: That 's true .
PhD B: So far .
Grad C: So .
Professor E: In the meetings so far , yeah .
Grad C: Yep .
Professor E: But we 're trying to expand this , right ?

What was needed for the transcripts?|Efforts by speaker fe008 are in progress to ensure that transcripts are clean (i.e. spell checked), channelized, and conform to set conventions regarding the coding of numbers, acronyms, and explicit comments (e.g. door slams, coughs, and laughter). Subsequent efforts by speaker fe008 will be to tighten up boundaries on the time bins. Inter-annotator agreement was reported to be very good.

So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um {pause} I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , "" here 's the web page "" , um , "" you need a password "" . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it .
Professor E: That 's {disfmarker} I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say {vocalsound} "" here is a {disfmarker} here is {disfmarker} "" I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but {disfmarker} but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , "" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK "" .
Grad C: I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .
Postdoc F: OK .
Grad C: the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it ,
Postdoc F: Alright . Fine . OK . Fair enough .
Grad C: so .
Professor E: Yeah .
Grad C: D you want me to grab one ?
Postdoc F: Sh - sh well I could {disfmarker} I 'm closer .
Grad C: Yeah , but you 're wired
Postdoc F: I could {disfmarker}
Grad C: aren't you ?
Postdoc F: Yeah . That is true .
Professor E: Um . {vocalsound} Yeah , I mean I don't wanna fool them ,
Postdoc F: I don't know {disfmarker}
Professor E: I just meant that e every {disfmarker} ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a {disfmarker} a bias that is presented ,
Postdoc F: Oh yeah yeah {disfmarker} oh I know .
Professor E: right ?
Grad C: "" If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . ""
Professor E: of {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Postdoc F: Yeah that 's true . Yeah .
Grad C: "" Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community .
Professor E: Yeah .
Grad C: There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . ""
Postdoc F: Hmm . Well that 's more open than I realized .
Grad C: Well , I mean it {disfmarker} The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said .
Professor E: I {disfmarker}
PhD A: Yeah .
Professor E: Yeah , uh no that {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} tha
Postdoc F: Tha - that 's true . That 's more severe , but the next one says the transcript will be around .
Professor E: that 's right .
Postdoc F: And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people {comment} you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . What it comes down to but {disfmarker}
Grad C: Yeah I think actually {disfmarker} my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good . You know , if {disfmarker} if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that .
Postdoc F: Oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh {disfmarker} i segment a against some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} personal {vocalsound} i th
Grad C: Right . That was all mumbled ?
PhD A: Yeah .
Grad C: I think Microsoft is
Postdoc F: Yeah exactly
PhD A: Oh ,
Grad C: Sorry transcribers .
Postdoc F: Or {disfmarker} or even {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or even {comment} there was a {disfmarker} a line you know about how "" hmm - mmm - mmm {comment} Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . ""
Professor E: Yeah .
Postdoc F: but {disfmarker} but it was all {disfmarker} the words were all visible , but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript .
PhD A: Oh , God .
Grad C: They 're gonna hate this meeting .
PhD A: Yeah .
Postdoc F: Yeah that 's true .
Grad C: Actually Liz will like it . You know , but .
Professor E: Liz will like it . We had a pretty strong disagreement going there .
Grad C: Yep , yep , that 's right .
Professor E: Yeah .
Postdoc F: Yeah . So I don't know . I mean , I {disfmarker} I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that {disfmarker} that my double checking will be {pause} so close to absolutely perfect that it {disfmarker} that nothing will slip by .

What were some of the ideas proposed about future meeting recordings?|PhD F wanted the group to record different meetings with the same group to help in tasks such as summarization, the Professor D however, wanted random meeting participants to have diversity that would be instrumental in acoustical research.|"[""Professor D: So uh {disfmarker} so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end .

Professor D: I mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine ,
Postdoc E: Mm - hmm .

PhD C: Yeah .
Postdoc E: Mm - hmm .
PhD F: Definitely .

Postdoc E: Can I {disfmarker} can I say about that {disfmarker} that the {disfmarker} the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers .

Professor D: Well , you want to i
Postdoc E: because it would not really be {disfmarker} it would be an interlanguage rather than {pause} than a {disfmarker}
Professor D: Well , OK , uh , first place , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I {disfmarker} I think that 's what we 're investigating ,
Postdoc E: OK .
PhD F: It has to be a {disfmarker} a pre - existing meeting , {pause} like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway .
Grad B: Right .
Professor D: Yeah , yeah .
Postdoc E: OK .
Grad B: Yep .
Professor D: So I was {disfmarker} I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their {disfmarker} hold their meeting down here .
PhD F: That 's I think what we {disfmarker} and I agree with .
Postdoc E: Oh , interesting !
PhD C: Yeah .
Postdoc E: Oh , I see . Oh , interesting !
Professor D: Uh , that 's the first point . The second point is um I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that {disfmarker}
Postdoc E: Oh , oh . I 'm not saying accents . u The accent 's not the problem .
Professor D: Oh , OK .
Postdoc E: No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency , e e just simply fluency .
Professor D: Yeah .
Postdoc E: I mean , I deal with people on {disfmarker} on campus who {disfmarker} I think sometimes people , undergraduates um in computer science uh , have language skills that make , you know {disfmarker} that their {disfmarker} their fluency and writing skills are not so strong .
Professor D: Oh ! You 're not talking about foreign language at all .
Grad B: Yeah . Yeah , just talking about .
Professor D: You 're just talking about {disfmarker}
Postdoc E: Well , e I just think ,
Grad B: We all had the same thought .
Postdoc E: but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , uh , no problem . I mean , I 'm not saying accents .
PhD C: Uh - huh .
Professor D: Yeah , then we 're completely gone .
Postdoc E: I 'm say I 'm saying fluency .
Grad B: Mm - hmm .
Postdoc E: Well , yeah . I 'm just saying fluency .
Professor D: But {disfmarker}
Grad B: Well , I think that , um {disfmarker} I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . And {disfmarker} and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , {comment} I {disfmarker} I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh , g particularly good English skills .
Professor D: Yeah .
Postdoc E: OK , now can I {disfmarker} can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that um , there 's {disfmarker} there 's this {disfmarker} this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for {disfmarker} for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together .
Grad B: Right .
Professor D: Right .
Postdoc E: And if people want to approach {disfmarker} Um , i so I know {pause} e e {pause} You know this {disfmarker} The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group ,
Professor D: Uh - huh .
Postdoc E: but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data ,
Professor D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Postdoc E: if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} um , i more fluent , more {disfmarker} more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing .

Meeting Transcript:
PhD F: the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something {disfmarker}
Grad B: True . Mm - hmm . Yep .
Professor D: Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something .
PhD F: Huh .
Grad B: Yep .
Professor D: You know .
PhD F: I {disfmarker} I think it 's not out of the question .
Grad B: Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting .
Professor D: Yeah .
PhD F: Um . So .
Grad B: another type of meeting .
PhD C: Yeah .
PhD F: Right .
PhD C: But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think you need , uh , another portable thing a another portable equipment to {disfmarker} to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI .
PhD F: Right .
Grad B: Hmm .
Professor D: Yeah .
Grad B: Right .
PhD C: Eh and probably . I don't know .
Professor D: Yeah .
PhD C: Eh , if you {disfmarker} you want to {disfmarker} to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you {disfmarker} you need {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It - it would be eh eh very difficult to {disfmarker} to put , {vocalsound} eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to {disfmarker} to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device .
Professor D: Yeah .
Grad B: Yeah , but {disfmarker} I think if we {disfmarker} if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy .
PhD C: Oh - yeah .
Grad B: Right ? That 's very easy ,
PhD C: Ye - Yeah , yeah .
Grad B: but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting .
PhD A: Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh , Aurora data and , um , first {disfmarker} first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , SPINE .
Grad B: SPINE .
PhD A: And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . So , um , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just {pause} the {pause} CD - ROM type data , the {disfmarker} {pause} the static data . So I moved that , and then um , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . before I actually deleted the old stuff , um , but I haven't heard back yet . I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked {pause} today to see if he 's deleted it or not . And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . And so , I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data . And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk . And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff . I have to meet with , uh , Stephane to do that . So .
Professor D: So , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but are we g do we have some other {disfmarker} other space now ?
Grad B: Yep . So , so , uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , and that 's probably enough for about four meetings .
Professor D: Yeah .
PhD A: Is that the one that has {disfmarker} is that DC ?
Professor D: Yeah .
PhD A: But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting {disfmarker} Or , you I think said , {pause} you know , or s Liz , said something about um , uh , "" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? "" I mean , how would you say that ?
Postdoc E: Yeah ?
PhD A: I mean , you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef
Grad B: if you wanted to anonymize .
PhD C: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , is {disfmarker}
Professor D: "" Is you know who up in you know where ? ""
PhD A: Yeah . Yeah .
Grad B: Mm - hmm .
Professor D: Right ? Use the {disfmarker}
PhD A: I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else .
Grad B: Yeah , darn ! I mean , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names .
Postdoc E: Well , it
PhD C: Yeah .
Grad B: but then , again that kills your discourse analysis .
PhD A: Right .
Postdoc E: Uh - huh .
PhD A: Yeah .
Grad B: Ugh !
Professor D: Yeah .
PhD C: Yeah .
Postdoc E: Yeah .
PhD A: I {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all .
Postdoc E: That 's {disfmarker} that 's the issue .
Grad B: Well , but that but that {disfmarker} as I said , that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that works great for the acoustics , but it {disfmarker} it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse .
Postdoc E: Well .
PhD A: Why ?
Postdoc E: Mm - hmm .
Grad B: Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus {pause} their {pause} name that they 're being referred to .
PhD C: Yeah .

PhD F: I have a {disfmarker} uh , um , question . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a {disfmarker}

PhD A: Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh , Aurora data and , um , first {disfmarker} first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , SPINE .
Grad B: SPINE .
PhD A: And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . So , um , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just {pause} the {pause} CD - ROM type data , the {disfmarker} {pause} the static data . So I moved that , and then um , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . before I actually deleted the old stuff , um , but I haven't heard back yet . I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked {pause} today to see if he 's deleted it or not . And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . And so , I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data . And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk . And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff . I have to meet with , uh , Stephane to do that . So .
Professor D: So , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but are we g do we have some other {disfmarker} other space now ?
Grad B: Yep . So , so , uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , and that 's probably enough for about four meetings .
Professor D: Yeah .
PhD A: Is that the one that has {disfmarker} is that DC ?
Professor D: Yeah .
PhD A: OK , I {disfmarker} but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we {disfmarker}
Grad B: I don't remember . Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is .
PhD A: OK , DC .
Grad B: I just don't remember , it might be DC .
PhD A: Yeah .
Grad B: And that has enough for about four more meetings right now . Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand .
Professor D: Mm - hmm .
Grad B: Um , someone deleted something somewhere . And so we have some room again . And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , so , you know , we have a couple weeks . Uh , so , yeah , I think {disfmarker} I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk .
PhD C: OK .
PhD A: So should , um {disfmarker} One question I had for you was , um , we need {disfmarker} {pause} we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk . Is there another backed - up {pause} disk that you know of that would {disfmarker} ?
Grad B: We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk {pause} rather than spreading them out .
PhD A: OK . Right . Right . Do you know what {disfmarker} happen to know what disk that is off {disfmarker} ? OK .
Grad B: No . I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head .
PhD A: Yeah . OK . Alright , I 'll find out from you .
Grad B: But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it .
PhD A: OK .

Meeting Transcript:
PhD F: I have a {disfmarker} uh , um , question . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a {disfmarker}
Professor D: They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} yeah , they 're d they 're uh {disfmarker} assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks .
PhD F: Cuz I mean , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? And {disfmarker} and I mean , there {disfmarker} there may be a lot more {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could um , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance
Grad B: I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this .
PhD F: Right , but {disfmarker} Right . But if there were such a {disfmarker} I mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here .
Grad B: Yep .
PhD F: So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the {disfmarker} the hardware .
Professor D: Well , the other thing {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .
Grad B: Right .
Professor D: Uh . But . Um , and {disfmarker}
Grad B: Well , I know that space is really scarce on {disfmarker} at least in CS . You know , to {disfmarker} to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult .
Professor D: Uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
PhD F: But you may not need a separate room , you know ,
Grad B: That 's true .
Postdoc E: Now , what will uh {disfmarker} Is the plan to g {pause} to {disfmarker} So {pause} stuff will be saved , it 's just that you 're relocating it ? I mean , so we 're gonna get more disk space ? Or did I {disfmarker} ?
Grad B: No , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable {disfmarker} regeneratable
Postdoc E: OK . Oh , good . I see .
Grad B: um , if we really need to , but we had a lot of them . And {disfmarker} for the full , uh , hundred forty hour sets .
Postdoc E: OK .
Grad B: And so they {disfmarker} they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something .
PhD C: Yeah .
Postdoc E: Wow . Wow .
Professor D: W w we are getting more space . We are getting , uh , another disk rack and {disfmarker} and four thirty - six gigabyte disks . Uh {pause} so {pause} uh {pause} but that 's not gonna happen instantaneously .
Postdoc E: Wonderful .
Grad B: Or maybe six .
Professor D: Or maybe six ?
Grad B: The SUN , ha uh , takes more disks than the Andatico one did . The SUN rack takes {disfmarker} {comment} Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . Whatever it was , it was , {pause} you know , fifty percent more .
Professor D: How many {disfmarker} How much {disfmarker}
PhD A: Is there a difference in price or something ?
Grad B: Well , what happened is that we {disfmarker} we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices .
PhD A: Oh !
PhD C: Oh .
Grad B: And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors . "" We "" {disfmarker} By "" we "" of course I mean Dave .

What did the team decide on in the last meeting?|Teletext will not be used and there will not be a control for everything. The buttons should be easy to find. The image of the company is to be incorporated in the design and a flip design is decided. Voice recognition is left out. The shape of the remote will be different than normal, like a shell or something along those lines. An alarm will be added in case the remote is lost.

Project Manager: I'll wait until you're all um hooked up .
Marketing: Oh good grief .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: 'Kay .
Project Manager: Okay . {gap}
Marketing: Oh .
Project Manager: Put it on in that way .
User Interface: Oops .
Project Manager: Thanks . Okay .
User Interface: Mm .
Project Manager: Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: After lunch . Yeah .
Project Manager: Right um this is our conceptual design meeting ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: um {vocalsound} I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well .
Project Manager: I th I I think {disfmarker} yeah um .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .
Industrial Designer: Etcetera .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . Um the minutes from the last time . Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a {disfmarker} leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost ,
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: things like that ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range .
User Interface: 'Kay .
Project Manager: Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
Marketing: Shall I ?
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: Yes if you feel {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay . We just connect up .
Marketing: {vocalsound} for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
User Interface: Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: because that {disfmarker} we are not {gap} for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: So , are we looking at voice {gap} ?
Marketing: Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,
User Interface: Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .
Marketing: is that right ?
User Interface: For l yeah , the whistle .
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah .
User Interface: So we can {disfmarker} if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
Marketing: And incorporating the company logo ?
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: Have you {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product
Project Manager: Well they do ,
Marketing: don't they ?
Project Manager: but I think we can {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours .
Project Manager: well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: and that does the work for you .
Project Manager: Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: so I'm not worried about that .
Marketing: Okay . Did we {disfmarker} I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
Project Manager: Depending on how i {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah , depending on the expense of it .
Project Manager: I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so
Industrial Designer: And they've got in stock , so yeah .
Project Manager: um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Right I'm going to wrap it up there .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Fine .
Project Manager: I got a end meeting now message on my mo
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: yeah
Industrial Designer: Did it ?
User Interface: Yeah .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} so . Um
User Interface: Again a questionnaire huh ?
Project Manager: so I think we've probably got {disfmarker} it says , closing we have forty minutes
Marketing: You got to go through .
Project Manager: so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back .
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took {gap} .
User Interface: I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now .

Summarize the discussion about the feedback on the design of the remote control device.|Market research was done with a hundred subjects and Marketing concluded the most important aspect required in the device is a fancy look and feel. The second and third important aspects are technologically innovative and being easy to use. Fruits and vegetables can be taken into consideration when thinking about design themes as they were the themes of fashion fairs in Paris and Milan. There is also a trend towards a spongy feel to materials.|"[""Marketing: Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,"", 'User Interface: {vocalsound}', ""Project Manager: It's okay {vocalsound} ."", 'Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}', ""Marketing: sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .

Meeting Transcript:
Marketing: Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's okay {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
User Interface: 'Kay .
Project Manager: Okay thank you very much . Um
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: let's start from the inside and work our way out .
User Interface: Fine . It's okay with me .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . {gap}
Marketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that ?
Project Manager: I don't think so , not yet .
Marketing: Not yet ? 'Kay .
Project Manager: Um , yes , thank you .
Industrial Designer: That screwed in ? {gap}
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: I hate those little things
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .
Marketing: {vocalsound} I know .
Industrial Designer: 'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .
Project Manager: Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .
Project Manager: Yeah , no , no .
Marketing: {gap} trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: but {gap} maybe we'll leave that one on the side .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: 'Kay .
Industrial Designer: I mean you can {disfmarker} you could do it , you could have a {disfmarker} 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh I think {gap} forget about the mirror
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay , okay .
Marketing: that was just a very quick passing thought yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .
Project Manager: Mm .
User Interface: So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . No particular remote is standard .

What are the actual components found in most remote controls that will be included in this remote design?|Industrial Designer explained that TA11835 is a chip used in pretty much every remote control to send out standard signals based on the input. On the other hand, most current remotes use a silicone printed circuit board (PCB board) which connects the circuits so that the messages would be sent to the chip. The size should be decided as the board can be custom made.|"['Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .

Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .
Industrial Designer: Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment .
Project Manager: 'Kay .
Industrial Designer: Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we {disfmarker} I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,
Project Manager: Wa {vocalsound} can you explain that ?
Industrial Designer: people won't {disfmarker} it's it's basically like wind-up radio .
Project Manager: Like a {disfmarker} right , okay .
Industrial Designer: So you wind up your remote control before you use it .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: How {vocalsound} {disfmarker} what kind of {disfmarker} how l long can you get out of that ,
Industrial Designer: It might {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: You {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get {disfmarker} when when you got T_V_ .
Project Manager: That doesn't count though does it ?
Marketing: Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?
Project Manager: I thought it was U_V_ like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: No .
Marketing: Artificial light ?
Industrial Designer: Is it ? Alright i
Project Manager: Any , any {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
Project Manager: What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .
Industrial Designer: if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,

What are the benefits and drawbacks for each battery option mentioned and what did Industrial Manager suggest to conserve battery life when discussing the design and availability of actual components?|Standard AA and AAA are bulky but the cheapest. Dynamo and dual charging with normal batteries and solar charging take up too much space. Solar charging is the second cheapest but not resistant to dropping. Also, Project Manager believed it would limit the market. Kinetic charging is small and portable but market research should be done first. No rechargeable battery options were available. The remote could have a standby mode and the lights behind the buttons would be switched off after five or ten seconds when not in use.|"['User Interface: Yep .

User Interface: Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or {disfmarker} and dynamo might take more space .
Industrial Designer: Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .
Project Manager: I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .
Project Manager: Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights
Marketing: Mm . Artificial light , no .
Project Manager: no , but I mean not many {disfmarker} you don't want to limit your market .
Marketing: That's going to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: I know ,
Industrial Designer: But {disfmarker}
Marketing: different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .
Industrial Designer: Yeah
User Interface: Right .
Industrial Designer: and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway .
User Interface: Night .
Project Manager: Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .
Industrial Designer: But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches
Project Manager: Yeah I've seen {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
User Interface: And are these like uh {disfmarker} what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
Industrial Designer: Um yeah it's {disfmarker} it charges into um some form of {disfmarker} it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
Project Manager: What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .
Industrial Designer: if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun .
Project Manager: I think the only
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: but I think pretty much we've used cheap {disfmarker} relatively cheap and simple things .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: The L_C_D_'s not cheap .
Industrial Designer: Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one ,
Marketing: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: I mean they use them in calculators so .
Project Manager: Yeah , okay .
User Interface: Maybe we could start with the black and white .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: That that way we could upgrade later {gap} .
Project Manager: And you could {disfmarker} yeah . Okay .
Marketing: Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm .
Marketing: we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Well you cou um .
Project Manager: Do you want like a back-up ?
Marketing: No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?
Industrial Designer: K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch {disfmarker} a battery that goes in a watch .
Marketing: I oh I see . Right , okay , got you .
Industrial Designer: So it's a lot smaller , so it would {disfmarker}
Marketing: Got you on that okay , didn't realise .
Project Manager: Um , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah .


Question: What are the benefits and drawbacks for each battery option mentioned and what did Industrial Manager suggest to conserve battery life when discussing the design and availability of actual components?

Summarize the discussion of the design of actual components regarding case material.|Titanium is too expensive, would be easily dented and could only do a standard box shape whereas plastic could be made into different curved shapes. Marketing suggested making the basic mould out of plastic with a rubber cover, which would give a spongy feel and be a cheap way to change the look of the device. Industrial Designer, User Interface and Project Manager quickly jumped on board with this idea.|"['Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .

Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
User Interface: 'Kay .
Project Manager: Okay thank you very much . Um
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: let's start from the inside and work our way out .
User Interface: Fine . It's okay with me .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . {gap}
Marketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that ?
Project Manager: I don't think so , not yet .
Marketing: Not yet ? 'Kay .
Project Manager: Um , yes , thank you .
Industrial Designer: That screwed in ? {gap}
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: I hate those little things
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .
Marketing: {vocalsound} I know .
Industrial Designer: 'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the {disfmarker} there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case {disfmarker} case housing
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process ,
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more {disfmarker} they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not {disfmarker} because we'd have it in two separate units
User Interface: Second thing is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Hinged , yeah .
Industrial Designer: for the flip phone .
User Interface: yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: So is that feature available in like uh titanium ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah I th
Project Manager: And you would just have an {disfmarker} across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming {disfmarker} I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Right .
Project Manager: And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes {vocalsound}
Marketing: which is another beauty of it .
Project Manager: y you know , you could just go so far with it ,
Industrial Designer: You can you can just {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: so I think that's quite a flexible thing .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case {disfmarker} casing {disfmarker} the case outside ,
Project Manager: Yes .
User Interface: it should be moulded {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} the design in such a way you can change it every time .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
User Interface: Okay . The rubber .
Project Manager: Yeah . Okay we've got five minutes , {vocalsound} um , or that might've been up for a while .
User Interface: Fine .
Marketing: Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}

Summarize the discussion of the design of actual components regarding interface design.|The team planned to do touch screen and there are two options to choose from, a bare PCB circuit board which could be in different colours and making a connection by the touch of fingers, and anti RSI rubber buttons with a LCD type of screen. Industrial Designer doubted whether a LCD screen is wanted as it would only be in black and white but have not thought out how to distinguish where to press if the bare PCB circuit board is used.|"['Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .

What did the team think about Marketing's suggestion of a sort of stylus to press the touch screen on the device when discussing the design of actual components?|Industrial Designer thought it would be lost easily and Marketing responded that it would be easy and cheap to replace or a pencil or pen could be used instead. User Interface pointed out that a person who switches channels often or uses a particular function will find it irritating to use and might spoil the touchpad more easily compared to a button.

Industrial Designer: Now what I was saying before about instead of having {disfmarker} you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over {disfmarker} if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen {disfmarker} 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they {disfmarker} you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch
User Interface: Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: display . Uh what what {disfmarker}
User Interface: Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could {disfmarker} becau you could fit it {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh-huh .
Industrial Designer: the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve {disfmarker} curved things with it ,
User Interface: Okay .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: but um you can {disfmarker} you wouldn't have {disfmarker} with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: With {disfmarker} W also with the {disfmarker}
Marketing: I don't {disfmarker} s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Oh it would be flat inside .
Industrial Designer: You could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,
Marketing: yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah .
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .
Industrial Designer: It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white ,
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: but there'd be touch touch buttons ,
User Interface: 'Kay .
Industrial Designer: so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .
Project Manager: I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Is rubber . Mm .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .
Project Manager: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out
Project Manager: Like one of the palm pop thing .
Industrial Designer: but I I think they could get a bit easily lost ,
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: Absolutely , f for somebody who {gap} very often , if he would {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: 'cause I had {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: It would have to be attached .
Marketing: They're easy to replace as well , cheap .
Industrial Designer: Hmm .
User Interface: a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface: and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: So there's not a {disfmarker} really a decision to be made there , um . The buttons {disfmarker} what did you give us as our {disfmarker} The bare-board L_C_D_ or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah the {disfmarker} well I think were {disfmarker} we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons ,
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: on the on the on on the top one we're gonna
Project Manager: On the top one okay you've got the touch
Industrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager: okay and then {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay , okay .
Marketing: Sorry could you repeat that last part ?
Industrial Designer: Um , okay on {disfmarker} we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .
Marketing: L_C_D_ screen . Mm-hmm . Okay .
User Interface: And for the {disfmarker} sorry .
Project Manager: No , it's fine .
User Interface: For the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah
Industrial Designer: Plastic ,
User Interface: we could use the body ,
Project Manager: For the inside .
Industrial Designer: okay .
User Interface: for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Mm-hmm ,
User Interface: {gap}
Marketing: so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,
User Interface: Plast right .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh I think so , I think so .
Marketing: okay . and it is just uh {disfmarker} although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,
Industrial Designer: Mm no .
Project Manager: No I think I {vocalsound} {disfmarker}

Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .

User Interface: 'Kay .
Project Manager: Okay thank you very much . Um
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: let's start from the inside and work our way out .
User Interface: Fine . It's okay with me .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . {gap}
Marketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that ?
Project Manager: I don't think so , not yet .
Marketing: Not yet ? 'Kay .
Project Manager: Um , yes , thank you .
Industrial Designer: That screwed in ? {gap}
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: I hate those little things
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .
Marketing: {vocalsound} I know .
Industrial Designer: 'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .
Marketing: Yeah just a thought {disfmarker} they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay , we'll talk about that {disfmarker} so if you finish your {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and we'll come back to that .
Industrial Designer: yeah that {disfmarker} that's the end of m my {disfmarker}
Project Manager: That's you , right okay .
User Interface: And just one small question before like you are {gap} , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .
Industrial Designer: Uh yeah . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple ,
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate {disfmarker} you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them ,
User Interface: Okay . Okay .
Marketing: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .
Marketing: I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
Marketing: If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?
Project Manager: No .
Marketing: And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display {disfmarker} th uh the remote control display thing .
Project Manager: We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
Industrial Designer: Um .
Project Manager: Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .
Project Manager: Yeah , no , no .
Marketing: {gap} trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: but {gap} maybe we'll leave that one on the side .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: 'Kay .
Industrial Designer: I mean you can {disfmarker} you could do it , you could have a {disfmarker} 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh I think {gap} forget about the mirror
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay , okay .
Marketing: that was just a very quick passing thought yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .
Project Manager: Mm .
User Interface: So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . No particular remote is standard .

Summarize the design and availability of actual components.|The chip TA11835 and PCB board will be used in the device. The use of kinetic charging was agreed by the team with a standby mode to save battery. The case of the device would be in plastic and would have a changeable rubber cover. LCD screens will be adopted. The idea of adding a stylus or a mirror to the device was rejected.|"['Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .

Meeting Transcript:
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
User Interface: 'Kay .
Project Manager: Okay thank you very much . Um
User Interface: Yep .
Project Manager: let's start from the inside and work our way out .
User Interface: Fine . It's okay with me .
Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay . {gap}
Marketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that ?
Project Manager: I don't think so , not yet .
Marketing: Not yet ? 'Kay .
Project Manager: Um , yes , thank you .
Industrial Designer: That screwed in ? {gap}
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: I hate those little things
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .
Marketing: {vocalsound} I know .
Industrial Designer: 'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .
User Interface: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the {disfmarker} there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case {disfmarker} case housing
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process ,
Project Manager: Mm .
Industrial Designer: which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more {disfmarker} they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not {disfmarker} because we'd have it in two separate units
User Interface: Second thing is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Hinged , yeah .
Industrial Designer: for the flip phone .
User Interface: yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: So is that feature available in like uh titanium ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah I th
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun .
Project Manager: I think the only
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: but I think pretty much we've used cheap {disfmarker} relatively cheap and simple things .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Marketing: Mm .
Project Manager: The L_C_D_'s not cheap .
Industrial Designer: Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one ,
Marketing: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: I mean they use them in calculators so .
Project Manager: Yeah , okay .
User Interface: Maybe we could start with the black and white .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
User Interface: That that way we could upgrade later {gap} .
Project Manager: And you could {disfmarker} yeah . Okay .
Marketing: Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging ,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm .
Marketing: we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Well you cou um .
Project Manager: Do you want like a back-up ?
Marketing: No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?
Industrial Designer: K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch {disfmarker} a battery that goes in a watch .
Marketing: I oh I see . Right , okay , got you .
Industrial Designer: So it's a lot smaller , so it would {disfmarker}
Marketing: Got you on that okay , didn't realise .
Project Manager: Um , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah .

What are the designs of normal remotes and how can the new remote be different from the normal ones?|Mostly black and white colours, the normal ones are monotonous without consistency between models, and the buttons are very disorganized. The new remote will have a graphic user interface in the middle of the flip top and certain standard buttons with vibrant fruit colours. A newly developed speech recognition feature can be incorporated in the device and the idea was endorsed by customers. User Interface gave an example of using the feature - locating the remote. The idea was well-received by the team.|"[""Industrial Designer: but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical ."", 'Marketing: Mm .

Industrial Designer: but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .
Marketing: Mm . So that affects the exterior design .
User Interface: Solar would be slightly {gap} expensives .
Project Manager: Expensive as well . What kind of price are we looking at for {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: They're they're expensive , they don't {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's twelve point f
Project Manager: I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the {disfmarker} It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping ,
Project Manager: Solar .
Industrial Designer: 'cause if you drop stuff {disfmarker} yeah if you if you have y
Project Manager: Well they're not designed {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if {disfmarker} remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .
Project Manager: Practical-wise okay .
Industrial Designer: Y I think {disfmarker} yeah , practically . I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot {vocalsound} whereas remotes you do ,
Project Manager: You do get a bit of wear
Industrial Designer: they can t
Project Manager: but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?
Industrial Designer: Yeah they do , they {disfmarker} yeah they've got dual things , but they're {disfmarker} the batteries are smaller I think .
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: Another question is like {disfmarker}
Marketing: Again it de
User Interface: sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .
Industrial Designer: Mm .
User Interface: A remote control , like ,
Industrial Designer: W m yeah
User Interface: so we have to s look at the life also .
Industrial Designer: Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
Project Manager: What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .
Industrial Designer: if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .
Project Manager: Yeah , no , no .
Marketing: {gap} trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much
Project Manager: Mm .
Marketing: but {gap} maybe we'll leave that one on the side .
Industrial Designer: Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: 'Kay .
Industrial Designer: I mean you can {disfmarker} you could do it , you could have a {disfmarker} 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh I think {gap} forget about the mirror
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay , okay .
Marketing: that was just a very quick passing thought yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .
Project Manager: Mm .
