"Barry Hughes first stated that children had fewer rights than adults and therefore the law should be enforced to defend physical assault. As such social behavior was not available now, the law should change to reflect that. The discussion then turned to talk about the legal framework and its prosecution.","The law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature. Barry believed that there was a need to update the guidance. And it was very clear that the CPS needed to make sure that the staff were sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law. In addition, the Children Act 2004"
"Barry thought that the legal framework would make things clearer for parents and professionals. But when it came to prosecuting, there was a degree of confusion and some cases were in the grey areas.","First, the law should reflect contemporary society and the law was evolutionary in nature. Secondly, to update the guidance, particularly at the stage of public interest, more effort would be put. And last but not least, the CPS would need to make people aware that the defense was not available in Wales in the same way that"
"The first stage was to check whether there was sufficient evidence submitted by the police to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Only if the first stage was satisfied, the second stage came to be considered, which was in the public interest.","First, there had to be a reasonable prospect of conviction. If there was not, the case would not be considered further, no matter how heinous the crime. Second, even if there was a reasonable prospect of conviction, the CPS had to consider whether prosecution was in the public interest. The public interest was a much broader"
"Barry Hughes indicated that the Bill would impact England and their people, although it needed a period. Moreover, Barry thought there was no cross-border issue from the potential legislation, and the draft changing to CPS guidance would not be helpful for scrutinisers to decide on the law in Wales.","Barry Hughes thought that they would need to update the guidance and make people aware that the defence was not available in Wales in the same way that it was in England. In terms of the public interest stage, they would need to develop more. He also said that the staff in Wales are aware of this already, but it"
"Barry Hughes concluded two kinds of implications. First, the Bill would raise awareness for people from England who travel to Wales. Second, people in other areas might reflect on this defense as they did to the drink driving limit in Scotland.","Barry Hughes thought that there had not been a very close-knit involvement, but they had enough involvement so that they had felt they were able to offer views on how they would deal with the legislation. It was the same as his opinion towards the application of the evidential stage. On the other hand, when it came"
"Barry Hughes thought draft changes to CPS guidance would not necessarily be helpful to the scrutinisers, and simply wanted to take the present interest factors. Barry thought they needed to work for the principles of generality and a degree of specificity.",Barry Hughes thought it was very likely that the CPS would need to update its guidance. He was not satisfied that the staff in Wales and across the border would be aware of the divergence in this area of law. He also said there might be minor financial consequences for the CPS. As for the data to see whether the change
"Barry Hughes introduced their cooperated organizations the National Police Chiefs' Council and their work on the out-of-court disposals. Then, Hughes and Vikki Howells talked about the possibility of creating a body of out-of-court disposals specific to the Bill. Lastly, there was a short discussion about the duty around awareness raising.","The Welsh Government is exploring the possibility of diverting more cases from prosecution to out-of-court disposals, such as restorative justice and other methods that avoid a criminal record. Under this approach, the police would be given the discretion to choose the most appropriate disposal for each case. The CPS would not be responsible for administering"
The National Police Chiefs' Council was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals.,"The police were responsible for the out-of-court disposal. The CPS might decide not to prosecute a case if it involved a 15-year-old youth, and they were not responsible for administering the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal. A good infrastructure could be built around"
"Barry Hughes thought that the infrastructure can be built for a range of out-of-court disposals. It might be built by the Welsh Government, the police, and crime commissioners.","First, he suggested that the police and crime commissioners could use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. Also, he thought it was very clear that policing was not devolved, while the CPS also was not devolved. The best way to approach this problem would be to build an infrastructure that provides a range of out-"
"Barry Hughes explained a number of unintended consequences questioned. The first one was about the isolated incidences in Wales, and the second came to the targets in terms of performance measure. The following concerns included malicious reporting, the European convention on human rights, low numbers of prosecutions, and a shortage of registered intermediaries.","First, there might be a situation that if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence will have different life prospects compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence. However, this was unlikely to happen as a simple answer, a criminal conviction inevitably has an impact upon one"
"Barry Hughes stated that they did not have targets and only prosecuted with reasonable prospects. As for the police, there were no targets for the police anymore, except for some individuals.",Barry Hughes agreed that there was a potential for targets to increase. He believed that the numbers would be tiny and would be dwarfed by the number of cases where there was a relationship breakdown between partners. He also pointed out that there was a greater potential for it to increase. He thought it was unlikely to cause a lot
"Karen Cornish thought it was a potential barrier but not a substantial barrier. The Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with it and there had had a number of people in the positions. However, it was true that the work required larger recruitment.","There had been a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and the Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with that, and a number of people were now in a position to act as intermediaries. It had the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, it would not be a barrier. The CPS had got"
"User Interface and Industrial designer drawn dolphin and pig, which the two animals have smart and easy-to-draw features. Marketing suggested a horse and Project Manager thought they should design a remote control that's water resistant, strong and furry. Also he mentioned that remote control will be priced at 25 Euros and aimed to earn a revenue of fifty million Euros. Therefore, Project Manager encouraged teammates to reflect on experience when designing its function and format.","Marketing drew a dolphin and listed its characteristics that it was pretty, sleek and it looked intelligent. User Interface drew a pig and described it as soft and strong. Project Manager drew a cat and listed its characteristics that it was furry, strong and could move around. The group agreed that those animals were all friendly and could make"
"The initial feature suggested by Marketing was easy to find and User Interface suggested a call button on the television. And Marketing wanted something that could vibrate or had a signal if it had no sound. However, they were not sure whether it is expensive to design it. So Project Manager suggested designing a magnet or portable phone based couch for the remote control, which people no need to walk over the TV to find it.",Marketing thought that the call button was a good idea but it should be under the sofa. User Interface suggested that a light should be attached to the remote control. Project Manager agreed and suggested that it could be a homing device. Marketing and User Interface both agreed. Project Manager thought that the remote control should have a screen
"Project Manager asked if the remote control needed to be made larger to avoid losing it. At the first beginning, User Interface suggested bigger, while Project Manager suggested a hand-sized device. Considering the light feature and putting noise on it, User Interface thought it would be feasible to make it mobile with a target price at 25 Euros.",The remote control should be big enough so that it's easy to find but not too big and furry. It's hand-held size and has a light on it. It can also make noise or vibrate so that it's easy to locate. The remote control should have as few buttons as possible and the
"Since User Interface initially suggested less button feature on the remote control, so Project Manager suggested a telly screen like what phones have. And User Interface mentioned about the master control in electronic houses. However, User Interface thought it is a bit expensive to create this feature, but Marketing mentioned the similar screen in phones is in the acceptable cost range. So, Project Manager agreed and suggested further discussion in the coming meeting.","Project Manager thought that it was worth exploring the possibility of incorporating a screen into the remote control, as the mobile phone screen was a good example. Project Manager decided that further research would be carried out before decision-making, as the budget was limited to twenty-five Euros. Also, Project Manager agreed on the importance of"
"User Interface reiterated that the remote control should have a robust and water resistant function. Marketing also mentioned a good tactile feel for the remote control function, which doesn't make hand sweat a lot. Therefore, Project Manager suggested a clip feature on the remote control so that people can clip it to their device.","The remote control could be easily lost under the sofa. Having a clip on it could help users find it more easily. Project Manager suggested that since there had been a similar design on the portable phone, it would also be feasible to apply the same idea on the remote control. Users could clip the remote control to something and"
"The selling price goal is 25 Euros and profit aim is fifty million Euros. Selling target is four million and the profit goal is fifty percent. So Project Manager mentioned that the group hopes to sell the remote control device internationally, instead of in Scotland or some European country.","Project Manager introduced the aim of the project was to produce a remote control that was original, trendy, and user friendly. Marketing Expert introduced the setting price and profit aim of the product. The setting price was 25 Euros and the profit aim was 50 million Euros. There would be 2 million sets and"
"Marketing gave some suggestions on the remote functional requirements based on marketing reports, which included a fancy look of the remote control, ease of use for elderly people, a button on the home station to trace its position, and speech recognition. So finally, the group mates suggested the usability and the color of the remote control based on Marketing's presentation.","The project manager informed the team that this was a TV remote control only. Marketing presented findings from market research, highlighting the need for the remote control to be attractive and for zap buttons to be good. Usability was deemed important. The team decided that the main focus should be on elderly people, since they make up a"
"When Marketing mentioned that their target group should be both young people and people above forty who were not keen on new features, Marketing thought it would be too expensive to have the speech recognition and not reachable for twenty-five Euros. Also, Marketing suggested a DVD player, stereo, and VCR for television.","Marketing pointed out that it would cost too much to add speech recognition to the remote control, which would exceed the budget of 25 Euros. Also, he thought that since the main target group was the elder generation, they would not be interested in this function. Therefore, it would be better to give up this function"
"When Marketing mentioned that they should make a new product that looked fancy, fashionable, and was easy to use for elderly users, User Interface suggested making sure that the remote control had better usability and could stand out by just being watched. Also, Marketing suggested a different color or different shape.","User Interface agreed with Marketing that the remote control should be easy to use, and suggested taking the elderly into consideration. User Interface also suggested that the remote control could be made into a mobile phone shape, with a dark appearance and modern features. In addition, User Interface disagreed with Marketing and Industrial Designer that the display screen should"
"Firstly, User Interface suggested the group should stand up with a unique design like different shapes than usual. User Interface also suggested a new option for favorite channels and a menu button that could integrate with volume, the previous and next buttons. The group agreed to make the remote a bit smaller and would like to look at mobile phones when designing it.","The user interface designer introduced the basic working design of the remote control, including the circuits, chips, Morse code, infrared light, and LED. They explained that when a button was pressed, a circuit would be closed and the chip would know which button was pressed. The remote control would then produce a Morse code and send"
"Industrial Designer desired to integrate remote controls for different appliances into one. Marketing pointed out that such integration would lead to too many buttons, which was not user-friendly enough. Instead, Marketing suggested that a menu display should be incorporated. Project Manager and User Interface agreed and added that basic buttons could remain. User Interface and Industrial Designer refused the flip top, however, for it costs a lot. The team temporarily chose lightweight plastic to be the material.","Project Manager proposed to develop a remote control which is original, trendy, appealing to a wide market, and user-friendly to all age groups. Marketing suggested focusing on the basic functions of on, off, volume up and down, channel one, two, etc. User Interface proposed to integrate everything into one and simplification of"
Marketing believed that most of the market would want convenient channel browsing and volume adjustment features instead of any tampering or programming with too many buttons. User Interface agreed with the simplification of symbols. The team came up with a menu display to make the remote more user-friendly.,"When discussing the remote control style and design optimization, Marketing first raised the idea of incorporating a menu display for that it would be more user friendly. However, Project Manager was concerned that the older generation might not be able to adapt to this change. User Interface then suggested a dual function design, keeping the basic button functions for"
"Industrial Designer initially worried about the replacement of buttons. Industrial Designer was soon convinced by Marketing that the age gap was a problem regardless of any design modifications and insisted on the incorporation of a menu display, however.","Industrial Designer assumed that as long as the remote control integrated intuitive menus, older people could use them. They also suggested that a black and white LCD screen could be used for the remote control. In addition, they agreed with Project Manager that a Windows-based remote control could confuse older people. They did not need to make"
Industrial Designer was uncertain about whether the remote could look fashionable with plastic at first. Marketing and Project Manager exemplified other remote controls to make Industrial Designer believe that silver plastic could look smart.,"When discussing remote control style and design optimization, Marketing proposed to use metal as the material of remote control. Considering the cost of the product, Project Manager proposed to use plastic and other materials. Industrial Designer agreed to use plastic and said that it would look good. In addition, plastic was cheap and could save costs. Therefore"
"Project Manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 Euros, considering the 12.5-Euro production cost. The profit aim for the team would be 50 million Euros in the first year. The market range would be international and over all age groups.",Marketing presumed that the target group of this remote control should be international and should be accessible and usable by all age groups. Project Manager agreed and suggested that the main target group of this remote control should be people with different ages who have different levels of skills of using remote controls. Users Interface suggested that the remote control should be
"Project Manager hoped to make the market range international, covering all age groups, instead of focusing solely on the business market. Project Manager highlighted that the team should not worry about the language differences and the big target group would be achievable.","Project Manager mentioned that the remote control would be an international market like Australia, America, etc. And the team should focus on the usability of the remote control for all age groups. Also, the team should consider the simplicity of the remote control."
"The user interface designer introduced three concepts in the user interface - Google controller, fancy controller, and intelligent controller. The three meant that the product would be simple but powerful, attractive and recognizable, and loaded with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology. The first two were approved by the project manager, but the last one was seriously questioned. After a lot of discussions, the group finally decided to mix the Google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands.","The user interface concept was discussed in the meeting. The user interface designer pointed out three major concepts of the user interface design, including fancy look, basic function and intelligence. The first two concepts were already discussed in the previous meeting. For the intelligence, the user interface designer suggested the application of voice and gesture recognition technology."
"The user interface designer believed a controller with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology would be convenient when you couldn't find it. More importantly, although the feature was not one hundred percent reliable, it was a feature to distinguish the new product from traditional ones. And there's not enough motivation for users to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller.",The user interface designer believed that the Google controller lacked attractiveness and fanciness. The intelligent controller could adapt to different languages. Users could use this controller in different countries. There would be no language barrier. Users could use this controller in various situations. This would be a breakthrough feature. Other controllers in the market all lacked this
"The project manager put forward that the speech recognition wouldn't work when several persons wanted to change the channel at the same time, and the cost would surely rise if adding the two technologies. In response to that, the user interface designer said they would just cooperate with some research institute and the vocabulary was limited, so it wouldn't cost much. Then the project manager posed the language problem. The user interface designer answered they would have some language adaptations so the product could be used by people from all countries. Finally, there were still problems with the microphone and camera that were necessary for the two technologies.","The user interface designer thought that the intelligent controller could attract a lot of users. However, the project manager thought that it was not practical and would not be used by most people. Also, the project manager was concerned about the cost of the intelligent controller. As a result, the project manager shut down this concept. With"
"The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects —material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood instead of plastic to make the controller more fashionable and having buttons with LCD so that people could see the controller in dark. In terms of the alimentation, it would be good to have both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation. Considering that the product was supposed to be easy to use, the industrial designer thought some low level chip would be enough, which was agreed by the group.","The remote control could be made from wood, plastic, rubber or titanium. The buttons could be push-buttons, scroll buttons or an L_C_D_ screen. The remote control could be powered by solar energy. In addition, it could have a docking station. For the recognition system, it could be an"
"With the solar energy alimentation, people in remote areas could recharge the controller more conveniently. Plus, it might attract some ecologists to purchase. Although the design would increase the production cost, it would be added value that can be compensated.","Having both the regular battery and the solar energy battery for the alimentation would add a little bit of the price. However, it would be an added value also that would be compensated. What's more, with the combination of these two kinds of energy, the remote control could be used in various situations, like being recharged"
"The group decided to use wood partly instead of plastic because they wanted to put fashion in electronics and wood was a good option. By contrast, the plastic material was more common, impersonal, and not so high class as wood.","The group would like to use a plastic material that is more common and very resistant. In addition, it is desirable to use solar energy as an innovative technology and to meet with the ecological theme. Meanwhile, the group would like to use a battery and to combine this with the fashion trend from Milan and Paris to attract customers"
"The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel rather than a functional one. Apart from that, they still wanted the product to be technologically innovative. At the same time, being user-friendly was also important. Then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice.","The marketing expert introduced the concept of Google controller, which is to make the remote control easy to use but with sophisticated functions. And also the fancy controller was introduced, in order to give the customers an attractive impression. And the last one was the intelligent controller, which used technology such as speech recognition to attract users. Project"
That year everything from clothes to shoes and furniture was inspired by fruits and vegetables so the marketing suggested taking that into account. The marketing also mentioned that people wanted a spongy touch which meant the product might be partly wooden and partly rubber-made.,"First of all, the marketing stressed the fancy look and feel of the product, which is the most important one among all the features. Then it suggested taking the idea of fruits and vegetables into consideration for the design of the remote control. Also, the marketing pointed out the importance of technological innovation and the easy-to-"
"To meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy, the group decided to use wood and rubber to make the controller. Maybe the part that users touched, such as the buttons, would be rubber, and the rest would be wooden, which would feel natural.","The team decided that fancy look and feel was more important than functional look and feel. Also, it should be technologically innovative and easy to use. And the design of the remote control should be inspired by fruits and vegetables."
"On battery issue, Industrial Designer expressed a desire to minimize the size of the battery. Meanwhile, cost, power consumption, wireless range and data transmission were supposed to be considered. User Interface's presentation followed. The remote control design would be simplified and user-friendly. To make the style more trendy, User Interface decided on a flip-top model.","Industrial Designer suggested that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of the wireless. User Interface suggested that the remote control could be designed with a flip-top model, with the main functions on the top and the complex functions in the middle part. In addition, User"
"Industrial Designer admitted that current remote controls were mostly powered by triple A batteries. However, Industrial Designer also pointed out that they were bulky, although they had been the smallest fit-in batteries at present. Industrial Designer expressed a desire to find a smaller alternative for triple A batteries.","Industrial Designer thought that triple A batteries were suitable for the remote because of the convenience of being recharged and the small size. Users could use a docking station at home and didn't need to go out and buy batteries all the time. In addition, a rechargeable design could reduce the size of the remote. Project Manager agreed"
"The market research presented by Marketing implicated that the remote control design was expected to be more stylish and less complicated. Project Manager added that an ideal model would be for TV only and have a corporate logo incorporated. To meet the requirements above, Industrial Designer recommended a touch screen panel. Marketing suggested that the remote control size could be adjusted due to physical differences among international users. The team gave up speech recognition, for it would cost a lot. An alarm would be incorporated for detection in case the remote control was lost in the house.","The usability lab had conducted research previously, with 100 subjects, to evaluate the general public's preference on remote controls. The research found that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, and are prepared to spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. However, the overall matching with the"
"The market research implicated that users' biggest frustration was their failure in finding the remote control once it was lost in the house. To solve the problem, Industrial Designer suggested that a button could be added on the TV; when the user pressed the button, the remote control would beep to let the user know its location. Meanwhile, such a solution would be within budget.","When discussing the market research and adjustments due to new project requirements, the group mentioned the importance of being original and different from what's out there. So, Industrial Designer suggested that they could design one product and have a number of different designs inside. In addition, Industrial Designer thought that they could consider speech recognition. Last"
"Industrial Designer was inspired by the design of Xbox and gave an example of Japanese people's small hands compared to the big controller. Out of ergonomic considerations, Industrial Designer encouraged the team to notice the physical differences among users all over the world when deciding the remote control size.","When Project Manager mentioned the importance of the corporate image in the new project, Marketing suggested taking consideration of different age groups and countries. Industrial Designer agreed and pointed out that the essence of the design should stay the same while making slight changes on the appearance. The user interface could also be adjusted accordingly. Taking the example of Xbox"
"Overall, the model style was expected to be trendy and appealing. Marketing and Project Manager agreed on User Interface's design of a flip-screen. Marketing also hoped that the remote control would be slightly curved. User Interface added that the remote control would curl up to users' hands so that their thumbs did not have to press. The corporate logo would be put in the corner. The model would be made of lightweight plastic with a smooth bottom and a nice scallop shell exterior.","The market research showed that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, and most people would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Also, most people take too much time to learn to use remote controls with many buttons. Therefore, the remote control should be user-friendly. In addition, people"
"Several members expressed their gratitude towards various groups such as first responders, working populations and different companies that have come together to help with the COVID crisis. Students whose education had undergone a radical change were highlighted and their fortitude appreciated. There was also a call to rally for disenfranchised groups such as rural residents, black lives movement and non-binary persons.",The first petition was about the government should commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on the Wet'suwet'en territory. And the second petition was about many constituents of
"The liberal of Government was accused of not allowing for adequate scrutiny of their spending. The Prime Minister was accused of locking down Parliament to avoid accountability, refusing to hold a first ministers meeting and refusing to negotiate to pass a bill.","The opposition party stated that the government was not transparent enough in handling the pandemic outbreak. The Auditor General's office was fired by the conservatives, and the funding was reduced. Now the conservatives were not allowed to table an economic update so that all members of Parliament could do their verification work. The government was also accused of"

The government pledged to provide assistance through various means, such as wage subsidies, loans, and rent relief. It was also promised that more funding would be"
The Prime Minister was quizzed on why he wasn't providing the money to allow the Auditor general to conduct audits on the Government's spending. The Prime Minister responded as to having increased the budget of the Auditor General's budget the previous year. The response was deemed unsatisfactory by the questioning party.,"Hon. Andrew Scheer questioned about the funding of the Auditor General's office. He mentioned that the Conservatives did not cut the funds but rather increased it by $6.5 million. However, the Liberals cut 60 staff. On the other hand, the Liberals claimed that they had increased the funding and added"
Members quizzed the Prime minister on what would happen to the CERB as many of their constituents were depending on it.

"Project Manager stated the meeting topic on function design. Firstly, Marketing concluded a study on user needs, including buttons for channel selection according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button, and suggested targeting on the nineteen to thirty-five years old age group to design functions. Next, User Interface presented on the technical effect on what functions users need and how to make the best functions for users. Then, Industrial Designer presented the working design, including input a channel or volume setting and output the location function to the television.","The group members first introduced the basic functions of the remote control, including the basic remote functions and the location function. Then they respectively introduced the components and the working design of the remote control. After that, the group members made a summary of the discussion and listed the new project requirements, such as the remote control would be"
"At the first beginning of the discussion, Industrial Designer mentioned that it would be easy to implement something like a buzzer to trace the remote location. Project Manager suggested a two-part package - on one hand, users could click the button on the TV to send out the signal; on the other hand, the remote base could beep probably so that users could know where the remote control has gone.","Industrial Designer thought that the function of the finder button would be realized by a radio signal like on a cell phone. The remote would beep when the TV sender received the signal. The two parts package would be sold separately. In addition, the target group should still be teenagers and young professionals. The call button could be designed"
"Marketing suggested the speech recognition design is for user groups aged from nineteen to thirty-five. Industrial Designer supplemented the feature design that if the TV is on and somebody says like one, then the TV would switch itself to channel one. However, Project Manager illustrated that considering the budget, to have the speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be expensive. And this ended up was commonly agreed by other group mates.","The group members first discussed the target age group of the remote control. Marketing suggested that the target age group should be 19-35 years old, for this age group has the highest willingness to pay for fashionable remote controls. Then, Marketing suggested the design of the speech recognition function for the remote control. Industrial"
Project Manager mentioned that the group needed to decide on the VCR capabilities and answered Industrial Designer's question on whether VCRs were the same across the world. So Industrial Designer suggested a whole different set of buttons for individual VCRs. Project Manager suggested DVD type if considering the target group as young professionals and teenagers.,The industrial designer suggested that they could design the remote control with a location function. The project manager agreed and suggested that they could target young professionals and teenagers. The marketing expert suggested that they could reduce the number of buttons and only keep the essential buttons. The user interface designer suggested that they could design only one menu button and
"First, Grad E proposed a question about better discriminating the definition of user and situation models, and it was necessary to set values for the models. Then, they discussed the issues in terms of the user's running budget, which was vital for the outcome of decisions. They tried to design a set of terms to describe the user's financial policy, such as thrift, average, spendy, or more finer scale ones.","The team was working on defining the nodes in their belief-net models. They had already defined some for the user model, including budget, thrift, and greasiness. They also had some defined for the situation model, including whether there was a strike, and if so, how severe it was. What was tricky"
"The reason why they mentioned user budget was that they wanted to take this example to further discuss the value for user model. Also, user budget was an important factor for the outcomes of decisions. Then, they tried to decide which set of words could represent the budget better. Finally, they found that the words that could describe financial policy of users, such as user thrift, was appropriate.","The group agreed that the user model could incorporate information on the running budget, which could be a crucial factor in decision-making. One way to realize this would be to assign a ""thrifty"" label to the user, reflecting his/her financial policy. In addition, the group thought that it would be necessary"
"Grad E proposed the idea that Go-there decision was also worth thinking about. Professor B suggested that the decision could stick to the discourse properties as a placeholder. With regard to the lack of ontologies, Professor B thought that it could use the same properties like exhibiting and selling. Grad E doubted the choice of binary EVA values, but Professor B insisted that it was still necessary to make this choice. Then the group members discussed the layout of belief-nets, for example, the connection between Go-there nodes and other ones such as endpoints. And Professor B reminded me that the belief-nets should not have loops.","The team decided that the ""Go-there"" node could only take two values: True or False. They also agreed that the endpoint decision node would feed into the Go-there node. Additionally, they planned to set up a placeholder for the discourse model. Loops in the belief network were forbidden."
"Grad E first started the topic about Go-there decision, and then proposed the question about how to represent discourse. Though Professor B insisted on using true-and-false values, Grad E challenged Professor B's opinion by taking examples about whether people really wanted to go some place or not when they asked how to get there.","Grad E first defined ""Go-there"" as a binary value of whether the person wanted to go there or not. Then, considering that they were dealing with the little data, Grad E suggested that they should stick to one specific direction first. In addition, Grad E pointed out that they were looking at the endpoint data"
"Professor B first emphasized the necessity of combining influences mathematically and asked Grad D to further explain the potential solutions. Then the students discussed the computation methods including weighted combination and mixture of experts, based on the mechanism of belief-nets. But there was no consensus on which method should be applied in belief-nets.",The group was working on a system that took a combination of inputs and produced an output. The basic problem was to specify the conditional probability of the output given all the inputs. One approach was to have each input contribute to the decision making process and the group was interested in having a weighted combination of the inputs. The weights
Grad D first said that different experts were reliable in different situations and it was necessary to organically combine them to make the network adapt to diverse situations. The network could be divided into several parts and the network would decide which of the experts would be trusted in this particular situation. Grad D then answered other group members' questions about the layout of mixture of expert models and their detailed computation process.,"The idea of mixture of experts is to have a new hidden variable that takes inputs from all the experts and produces a number indicating which expert to trust. This is slightly more complicated but allows the model to adapt to different situations. There are only three possibilities for each node, so at most three experts are needed. The output"
"Based on the presentations of the user interface designer, the industrial designer and the marketing expert which were about the product requirements, the project manager concluded that the new remote control should be powerful, easy to use, fashionable, recognizable and only for television. Furthermore, the remote control should use the Internet rather than teletext due to the spread of the Internet.","The teletext would be an outdated function and the internet would be a better choice. The remote control would only be designed for televisions rather than other devices like the recorder or garage door. The real reaction color, yellow, should be used to make the remote control fancy and to attract customers. Also, the slogan ""put"
"The user interface designer recommended to design a Google TV controller because Google was very successful for its powerful functions and friendly user interface. Also, to make the customers able to use the product without learning the manual, the industrial designer suggested applying some international standards such as some pictograms.","The user interface designer and the industrial designer both recommended to focus more on the technical function design than on the appearance design. The reason was that if they could design the functions well, the appearance could be designed by another person. Also, they recommended to use the Internet instead of the teletext.

However, the technology was not very popular, which might be an obstacle for global usage of the product.","The industrial designer proposed to connect the TV to the Internet so that users can surf the web. However, this idea may increase the cost of the remote control. In addition, this function may not be popular among all users. Therefore, the project manager asked the team to think about whether this function is necessary. If this"
"The group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller because it was cheaper than a laser. Secondly, the industrial designer preferred a wireless remote control as it was easier to manage but the suggestion was doubted by the marketing and the project manager considering the cost and user requirements. Another thing was about the buttons. The marketing advised having less buttons because only ten percent of the buttons were actually in use and people tended to zap a lot.",The industrial designer proposed an infrared remote control because it was cheaper. The remote control could be with or without wires. The user interface could be designed with either a wire or without a wire. The designer preferred the wireless one. The average price of the wireless remote control was eight Euros.
"Firstly, the industrial designer said the wireless technology would cost 8 Euros which was higher than the manager's expectation. Secondly, whether the users would like to have a wireless control or not was unknown and the marketing would go to figure it out. Finally, having a link between the remote control and the television would prevent control from losing.","The industrial designer thought that a wireless control would be more practical and easier to manage, while the project manager thought that a cable link would be more feasible and cheaper. Also, the project manager thought that the problem of losing the remote control would be more serious for wireless control. Last but not least, the project manager said"
"The industrial designer recommended mixing several functions in one button by having a switch menu. For example, the category the functions into several classes and link switch menu to this kind of this category of functions.","When discussing the problem of having fewer buttons, the user interface designer pointed out that several functions could be mixed into one button.

"Based on earlier experiments and questionnaires, the marketing found that seventy-five percent of the users thought most remote controls ugly. Thus, the group decided to make the product look fancy so that people would pay more. However, how to make remote control look fancy was a big problem because different people have different opinions about fancy. What's more, the project manager thought the product should be recognizable and attractive.","The remote control would only be used for television. Therefore, the design of the remote control should not be too complex. Also, the remote control should have a fashionable and attractive image to draw the attention of customers.

In addition, the user interface designer suggested that there should be several options for users to choose from. On the other hand, the industrial designer thought that"
"The project manager agreed that the product should be good-looking but having many colours wasn't a good idea because it would increase the product cost. Also, the project manager thought the remote control should be marked with the image of the society so that one can recognize it at a glance.","Project manager would like the remote control to be with many functions but easy to use. Buttons should not be too many. Remote control with the fashion design, the color of which should be yellow. Besides, it is expected that the remote control can only be used for TV.

"Mr. Dan Albas asked about the handling of fraudulence by the Canadian government but Right Hon. Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister, was saying that the government put giving support and help to Canadians in the first place. Then Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie questioned the reason why the government supported the profiteers for tax evasion when implementing the large employer emergency financing facility. However, Right Hon. Justin Trudeau thought they were making plans to help workers to survive this pandemic and was always their priority to overcome. Hon. Candice Bergen required that how they were dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada and put out a violence case that why the Liberals were making this gun illegal and What the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle was. It was demonstrated by Hon. Bill Blair that many Canadians were murdered by these guns which was their explanation of banning guns.","The first petition called for the government to work with provinces and territories to find a collaborative, holistic solution so that every Canadian has a family doctor. The second petition took issue with how the Liberal government continued to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal weapons smugglers responsible for the violence in"
"Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie first asked the prime minister whether the government would outlaw what was immoral and then, put it precisely, made an example that a bank relocated its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and registered them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven. Under this situation, the government might not consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in Canada and that was why Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie said that the Prime Minister continued to support the profiteers.","When Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie learned that the government would provide financial support for those who had carried out tax evasion and avoidance through tax havens, he considered that the Prime Minister continued to support the profiteers. He then asked for more attention to be paid to those who had paid their fair share of taxes. He"
"First, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles, except for law enforcement and military purposes. And Hon. Bill Blair thought what their regulations said very clearly, was that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers in Canadian society.","The firearms had in their earliest provenance a design for military use, for soldiers to use in combat. Those were the weapons that have been banned. Moreover, any Canadian killed by gun violence was one too many.

"During the pandemic of Covid-19, the government should fix this gap so that the single parents and their children could get the support they need. Also, matching funds and adequate housing should be given to support the affected in Canada. In addition, the elderly, one of the highest risk populations, had obtained extra funding from the government. Besides, vulnerable people like the disabled could gain more funding support and workers affected by the pandemic could also gain support.","The member for Vancouver Kingsway suggested that the government's support for the elderly and for vulnerable people were not enough during the pandemic outbreak. The Minister of Health reassured that the government had offered financial support to those senior citizens who were eligible for OAS and GIS respectively. In addition, the ministry would offer help to those living"
"Ms. Jenny Kwan gave an example that a single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. She paid taxes on her spousal income, but she was not eligible for CERB. That meant a complicated program delivered by the government that left many people behind, and more importantly, there was no action reacting to it. So Ms. Jenny Kwan called for a fixation for this gap and proposed that matching funding and adequate housing should be arranged for those who were affected.","The government had a plan to help those single parents with four school-age children lost their spousal and child support due to COVID-19.

"Since Quebec was Canada's biggest producer of hydroelectricity, renewable energy sharing through an energy corridor was very essential for different areas in Canada. And as a hard-hit sector, tourism needed much support from the Canadian government. The government was going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions would be ready when the economy reopened. When it came to the green economy, the government now gave priority to the virus and making through this disaster.

"During the pandemic, the lobster fishery was being negatively affected and was facing losses of up to 95% of its Asian markets. Many fishermen had their wives, their sons, their uncles or their fathers working for them, and sometimes it was the whole family on the boat. Moreover, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals were having to deal with considerable losses of income. As for oil and gas, western Canada oil storage is under extreme pressure. If thermal projects such as SAGD are shut down, those facilities could be lost forever. The oil and gas sector was suffering through two crises --COVID and the effects of a global price war.","The Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard introduced that to help the fishery, the government had started to put measures in place for the $62.5 million for processors, and to make sure that the CERB was available for seasonal workers as well as people who had run out of their fishery EI."
"The fish and seafood sector had been extremely adversely affected because of COVID-19. They've started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB is available for seasonal workers as well as people who had run out of their fishery EI, but they knew that more needs to be done. The fishery enterprises were uniquely structured, which was why they were looking at measures to address the concerns they had. Because of the unique structure of fishing enterprises, they were not eligible for many of the supports they had put in place. They had made changes to the CERB to make sure that people who ran out of the fishers EI were eligible as well as seasonal workers.","The petitioners cited that the expansion would increase environmental degradation, as seen in similar aquaculture operations in British Columbia, Newfoundland, Norway, Vietnam and elsewhere in the world. They also raise concerns that open-net finfish aquaculture would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries. The government started to put measures in"
"The oil and gas industry was under severe strain. Over the past number of years, they had seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down. The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the Bill C-69, which would prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry. These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels. To compound Alberta's economic problems, we have an international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a huge drop in demand for oil.","The Canadian oil and gas industry provides jobs for more than 576,000 people, including 11,000 indigenous people, in every part of Canada.

"Industrial Designer introduced uncurved, single-curved and double-curved design at first. User Interface and Project Manager thought that uncurved design was too dull and Industrial Designer pointed out that double-curved design would make it impossible to use scroll-wheels, so the team selected single-curved design eventually.","There were three options about the casing style - uncurved, single-curved and double-curved. The double-curved case was limited in color and could not be made with titanium. Also, the double-curved case was not suitable for the integration of LCD displays and scroll wheels. Therefore,"
"Industrial Designer proposed to use scroll-wheels, which could be integrated with buttons. User Interface doubted its practicability and then Project Manager proposed to integrate a scroll-bar on the side to mute the device. As they would not use an LCD display, a regular chip was enough.","The remote control should be made with a material that is spongy and soft so that it is easy in hand. Also, it should be colourful and attractive, like an apple. Besides, the remote control should have a shape design underneath so that the fingers can put into it and it can be held with less pressure. Last"
Industrial Designer proposed to use scroll-wheels integrated with buttons. User Interface doubted its practicability and supposed that a round button with four directions could be better. But Project Manager liked the idea of scroll-wheels as it might attract young customers and suggested that they could be used to mute the device.,"User Interface suggested making four push-buttons in a form of a round. Industrial Designer thought that the scroll-wheel was a possible option as it had been done before in other devices like telephones. Project Manager agreed and suggested some functions could be integrated with the scroll-wheel, such as volume selection and mute. Marketing commented"
"Industrial Manager revealed that if LCD was used, they had to choose advanced chips. Project Manager thought it was within the budget and LCD displays could add extra high-tech feeling. User Interface then pointed out that they already had too many high-tech substances including scroll-wheels, voice recognition and a fancy look so they didn't need to use LCD displays.","Industrial Designer thought that LCD displays were not necessary because TVs could display information on screen. Also, LCD displays were more costly, while the simple chip was much cheaper. Meanwhile, scroll wheels were needed for voice recognition and the team agreed that it was better to use a more reliable and cheaper solar cell. Thus, LCD displays"
"The thesis proposal presents the idea of ""construal"" and makes claims as to how inferences are drawn in a probabilistic relational model by using information from the ontology, situation, user and discourse models. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy.","The thesis is about using conceptual combinations to model the semantics of event schemas. It is argued that current approaches to modeling event schemas do not adequately capture the phenomenon of semantic ambiguity. In addition, the thesis aims to provide a more complete account of the semantics of event schemas by incorporating aspects of the situation, such as the physical"
"The talk will present the work that is currently being done at ICSI including examples of inference of user intentions and of the recordings of the on-going data collection. The talk will also outline the theoretical (X-schemas, image schemas, Bayes-nets) and neural background.","The group was collecting information and writing a paper for a talk at EML. The focus of the talk was on the SmartKom system and the progress made. Additionally, the group wanted to use the talk as a means to sell their ideas to potential investors, like Wolfgang Wahlster. Lastly, the group wanted to generate"
"As the talk at EML will also refer to a theoretical framework, it was suggested that along with presenting NTL and the piece on mirror neurons, it also alludes to relevant fMRI work. The neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups. The language analysis itself will be introduced in terms of image schemas. On the other hand, it was arranged for more feedback on the thesis proposal to be sent by email. The latest version of the construction formalism will also be needed to complete the presentation.","The group had some minor changes to make in the presentation. The speaker wanted to include information about the FMRI to see how the group could learn more about the neurons. Additionally, the professor wanted the group to be able to explain the difference between language understanding and the embodied and simulation approach. Last, the group needed to"
Using multiple languages led to more diversity which potentially hindered the model performance. The professor was skeptical about discussing the results since they had not received any good ones so far.,"The professor thought that they had previously found some results that indicated that training on one language and testing on another produced poor results. However, the professor thought that the results in the current paper were different, as they involved testing on the same type of digits. The professor wanted to know what the noise conditions were for the different"
"PhD D explained that the multilingual model, trained on French, Spanish, and English, was trained with higher frame rates. It has slightly poorer results when delta was not used. All in all, the addition of English did not seem to help the model.","The error rate of the model trained on the multilingual data (broad data) is around one point one to one point three times higher than that of the model trained on the task-specific data. The difference is not that big. Also, there is not a big difference between models that do not use delta features but the"
The professor thought that the model did not get hurt that much because of the removal of English. He also thought it would be worthwhile to train on one language and test on another.,The professor thought that the results showed that it was not so much cross language as cross type of speech. He also suggested that they be careful since they had not gotten good results yet.
"The team discussed the size of the neural net, which was just a simple net. At the time, it had 27 outputs, but the professor recommended that they use a larger net, with perhaps more features. They discussed the effect that removing silent frames could have on the model. The professor recommended having a bigger hidden layer, though he did not think that would substantially improve performance. Currently, however, the team was facing computational limitations.","The team was making progress on reducing the complexity of the model. They had identified several places where they could do so, including by using a smaller amount of data to train the models, and by simplifying the structure of the models themselves. In addition, the team was making progress on developing more efficient algorithms for performing recognition."
"The team was concerned about the availability of computational resources. The Professor informed them that they had received two 550 megahertz processors by IBM. Though, they were originally expecting eight 800 megahertz processors.",The professor informed the team that he had ordered a new Sun computer. He explained that the team would receive it soon and it would improve their models. He also wanted to know how much the team was using Linux on their machines. He thought that perhaps they should use it more often to speed up their work. The team
The team talked about delays when discussing the removal of frames that were silent. This could possibly improve model performance at the cost of a small delay.,"The professor thought that perhaps the team could reduce the number of bits they had to transmit by detecting silence. He was not sure what exactly the team had done in the table, though. The professor thought that the LDA introduced delays, but the parallel path did not. He thought that the neural network was slowing down the model"
"The committee admitted that the funding issues brought more pressure on schools, especially after the new Act, for they would have to spend more in the light of it. It was pointed out that the government had not noticed the staff in the PRU, who required training. The committee was trying to communicate with Estyn and the Welsh Government for a broader range of measures to provide opportunities for schools and local authorities.","The additional learning needs sector is affected by the funding issues, as some schools had to cut costs and reduce the number of staff. Also, the government did not think about the staff in the pupil referral units, because they had to make an extra payment to ensure that these staff could receive proper training. And it was difficult"
"David Hopkins agreed with Sharon Davies that the new Act would exert more pressure on schools. However, he denied that the levels of the delegation would have any impact. Meanwhile, he suggested that it would be better for the schools' headmasters and local authorities to look at the new Act more constructively, for it would be beneficial for the post-16 sector.","David Hopkins thought that there was a chance that more people would be expelled from schools if they did not adapt to the new Act. Also, he believed that the quality of education would be under pressure as a consequence. Last but not least, he pointed out that particular attention should be paid to the ALN (Additional Learning"
"David Hopkins did not think that the delegation levels were not high enough in most authority areas. Instead, he thought they had got agreements with the government to make sure that enough money was devolved to school. The true decisive factor was the narrow measure at the end of Stage 4 that drove the headmasters to exclude students or put them into another school.","The most obvious one was the pressure at the end of key stage 4 attainment, which had put pressure on some schools and headteachers. Also, on the additional learning needs side, while the Minister had currently made some more money available, the experiences that had happened in England showed that ALN funding had become increasingly under"
"There had been improvements in the networking within the PRU, for they had national meetings on a regular basis, which could lead to a better sharing of practice. The PRU was planning to provide teachers with professional training. On the transition arrangement, the PRU was building a brand new provision in Swansea. The PRU would support students through a part-time timetable back into school. Besides, the support would not stop as soon as the students returned to school; the reduction of support would be managed.","The first improvement that Nick Williams pointed out was the regular meeting which was a national level conference about the better sharing of practice. The second was the integration through a part-time timetable back into school. To conclude, there had been a big investment of time and money into the new PRU provision in Swansea, which would"
"The students coming to the end of their statutory education were facing the biggest challenge, for it would be far more difficult for them to go back into the mainstream education process when they turned 15 or 16, not to mention the transition into further education, such as colleges.","Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that the additional learning needs sector was adversely affected by the funding issues and the challenges. Sharon Davies agreed that there was pressure, in particular with the new Act coming in, which placed more pressure on the system. And it was difficult for the schools to plan ahead for the changes, and"
"Sharon Davies recommended the team-around-the-family approach to ensure what was needed for learners to go back into school, as well as what the school could provide. She pointed out the importance of the whole package of support, which not only surrounded the learners but also their families. In addition, she gave an example of the PRU in Oxford who built the partnership between the school and the PRU student to demonstrate the responsibility of schools and the significance of school participation.","To answer this question, Sharon Davies first suggested that the schools were challenged by the pressure of the new Act and limited funds, which made it difficult to retain the students and offered proper support for them. And then, according to Nick Williams, to solve this problem, the government should think of the staff in the pupil referral"
One of the advantages was that youngsters' voice could be heard in time if they showed the willingness to go back into school; the framework offered the excluded learners a cooling-off period. The disadvantage was mainly some individual schools' lack of capacity to organize and offer additional training. Monitor and evaluation systems of the EOTAS provision were supposed to be set up to ensure the education quality.,"The first strategy they had was to develop a behaviour and well-being strategy, which aimed at equipping the schools with skills to meet the needs of the learners. However, they found that it was hard to bring everyone to the same level. And it was also difficult to balance between having strict rules and being flexible to the"
"Sharon Davies expressed her strong objection to the exclusions caused by tuition or safeguarding. She pointed out that the difficulty with home tuition was the limited access the local authority could get into the families. The quality of home tuition was difficult to assure, unless the families invited them there, which was a really rare situation. All in all, the role of local authorities was restricted in this aspect.","Sharon Davies thought that it was difficult for local authorities to quality assure the individual tuition because they were restricted on how much access they got into the home. Local authorities were limited in terms of visiting the families and making sure that the process was going on smoothly. However, he also agreed that the momentum should be kept going to"
"The intuition in a private setting was supposed to follow a restricted timetable, for no matter for what reason the students' need cannot be met at school, the PRU staff ought to provide them with some education. Besides, the education provided should be different from the education provided by agency staff, who merely offered a few hours' provision or the service offered by local libraries.",The local authority was restricted on how much access they got into the home for the intuition. They were also limited in quality assurance. They did not use agency staff to go in and provide a few hours of provision. They prioritized the staff who worked for the local authority. They did not know whether this was widespread around Wales
PRU was supposed to collaborate with schools to arrange special curriculums to meet the students' special needs. This not only had something to do with finance but was also related to the recruitment of professional staff. The training for special education ought to be included in the professional training system.,"The first problem raised by Janet Finch-Saunders AM was that pupils in PRUs and then trying to get back into mainstream education encountered many obstacles. Nick Williams suggested that to solve this problem, a big investment of time and money would be made to build a brand-new PRU provision. Meanwhile, the support for"
"Dawn Bowden pointed out that there were a very small number of staff members working in the provision area, and the capacity for them to access professional training was limited. Sharon Davies agreed and added that though the situation had been bettered by the Internet technology, there was still not much opportunity for the ones who desired to specialize in the area.","The first challenge was that those who had received special training might move on or retire, creating a shortage of staff with expertise. The second challenge was the limited capacity of training institutions. To conclude, the shortage of staff would in turn limit the ability of local authorities to encourage specialists to share expertise with independent providers. At the"
"There were more issues related to transport for EOTAS learners in the rural areas of Wales. The distance that the learners had to cover was huge, for they had to get a provision in Powys. However, WLGA (Welsh Local Government Association) admitted that this issue had not been investigated yet would be in investigation very soon.","The distances that learners are having to travel from the north to the south of Powys are huge. The same problem exists in other rural areas of Wales. As a result, learners would be difficult to access a broad and balanced curriculum and appropriate learning opportunities. And it would also be difficult for them to have a positive learning"
"Marketing summarized the user requirements according to the market reports. Users expected a fancy look, technological innovation, and minimization of repetitive strain injury. The team did a preliminary rating using a seven-point scale. The results were that the remote control's fashion style and location function were most highly rated, but the team was not satisfied enough with the minimization of repetitive strain injury. The team agreed on further modifications to the current prototype.","The team had designed a remote with a focus on current fashion trends, like fruity and vegetable themes, spongy texture, etc. Also, it was required to have technological innovation.

"Marketing initially doubted that Industrial Designer was limited in the use of materials for the prototype, which would harm the fashion style. Marketing was soon convinced by Industrial Designer, however, that the changeable faces would allow users to customize their remote controls. Besides, the rubber case would give a spongy feel. Marketing thus rated one point for Industrial Designer's style design.","During the evaluation process, Marketing asked team members how they felt about the incorporation of current fashion trends in the prototype, particularly in relation to the market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours. Industrial Designer pointed out that the prototype was limited in the use of materials and colours and it"
"Marketing considered the design of pointers unfeasible, for many users were prone to zap. Project Manager recommended the slight and small-sized buttons with more space in between. Regretfully, the team failed to come up with a perfectly feasible solution to the problem. The team thus gave low rate points to the prototype's minimization of repetitive strain injury.","The team agreed that the rubber case could reduce the repetitive strain injury because it was slightly different from other remote controls and brought new ideas into the market. Also, the team decided to use the flip top which was first used in mobile phones. It would be easy to find the remote control if it was lost and prevented the"
"The team calculated the cost of the remote control in the Euro. The team included one regular chip, one kinetic cell, one double-curved bottom, one push button, one LCD screen, as well as rubber and plastic materials.

Overall, the present cost was 12.5 Euros and was under the budget.","The project cost ended up being lower than expected, with a final price of 12.5 Euros. However, the team was unsure whether this amount took into account various overhead costs. Also, they needed to check if this price was high enough to generate a reasonable profit (50%) for the company. If"
"User Interface recommended the standard batteries to replace the kinetic batteries and lower the cost. Marketing was promised by User Interface that the change in battery type would not make any big difference in shape and colours. However, Marketing was still uncertain about the replacement. User Interface further explained that users were used to paying little attention to batteries which were installed internally.","User Interface thought that customers had never commented on the battery. It was something internal and nobody cared about it. The shape and the colour were more important to customers. Therefore, User Interface suggested that they could replace the expensive kinetic batteries with ordinary ones to reduce the cost. The Industrial Designer agreed. With this change, the"
"Industrial Designer implicated that if the kinetic batteries were replaced by the standard batteries, the voice recognition would have to be taken away as well. Project Manager, therefore, made a compromise that the team might provide the voice recognition in an upgraded version for the business class who expected high office specifications.","The team initially favoured the idea of incorporating voice recognition into the remote control, but this feature was deemed to be too costly. Moreover, the distinctive design of the remote control was expected to make it easy to locate, reducing the need for voice recognition. Therefore, the team decided to proceed with the plan of releasing a standard"
"Marketing proposed that the fancy look and feel were more important than the functionality of the product. The fruit and vegetable theme was the current trend, and marketing himself preferred fruits to vegetables. Therefore, how spongy the material could be should be taken into consideration when choosing the materials. The potential materials to accomplish the fruit and vegetable theme could be a sort of rubber, which was used in the stress balls. The alternative option was to use a cover for it, and choose a colour that fits one's sitting room.","The Marketing specialist announced that the current trend in fashion was fruit and vegetable themes. Therefore, the remote control could incorporate one of these themes. Additionally, users preferred technology innovation and simplicity. The group then discussed the material of the remote control. The Marketing specialist suggested a spongy material. After some discussion, the group decided to"
"Industrial Designer thought some parts needed custom design, and other parts should just use standard. For example, the case needed custom design to protect the remote and the locator, and the circuit board needed custom design as well, while the buttons and the wheels, radio sender and receiver were all standard parts. In addition, beeper or other noise things were needed as well for locating the remote. Rubber, plastic, wood and titanium were options of materials, but better not titanium. Regular chips were required if the iPod-style wheel button was used.","The industrial designer had been looking at the component design, mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet. For the case, the options were rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. The team could choose according to their budget. For the circuit board, it would be custom designed. Other standard parts included buttons, wheels,"

Without a screen, the user interface would only have the wheel. Through the wheel, the user could control the channel and volume. The group supplemented that the screen was essential for the menu option. If the screen was removed, the brightness of the television could"
"Battery, solar power, dynamo, Kryptonite were potential options of the energy. They ended up with a preference on Kryptonite. Even though they could not find an exact price for it, it would not be more expensive than a chip.","Solar power was ruled out because it was not available with the rubber case. The group then considered a dynamo, which was essentially a battery that could be recharged by kinetic energy. This option would allow the remote to be used for a long time without having to replace the battery. The bulk of the cost would be the chip"
"Industrial Designer preferred battery. Industrial Designer was not very familiar with dynamo. Wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power were all possible, but solar power would not be available with the rubber case.","The Industrial Designer suggested three options of energy: batteries, solar power, and dynamo. The first two options were feasible for the remote control, while the last one was not suitable for the living room. Also, the solar power was not available with the rubber case. Considering the cost, the chip was the most expensive part"
"The website did not give an actual cost, but most of the stuff was cheap. The chip would be the most expensive part anyway, so the group should not worry about the cost of the Kryptonite too much.","The group selected battery as their energy source due to the convenience it offers. Although the dynamo was interesting, it was not practical for a living room setting. Solar power was also ruled out because it was not compatible with the rubber case. Therefore, the group decided to move forward with the basic battery energy source. No cost"
"Adding the neural net was doubling the number of deletions. The model did not improve significantly, however, thought it became better at some tasks. The results were a mixed basket and it was decided that further experimentation was necessary.","The team was concerned about a high number of deletions, especially in highly mismatched conditions. It was decided that they would experiment with the VAD to see if that was the source of the problem. Additionally, the team thought that the MLP may be too rigid and that improvements could be made by using more context-dependent units"
"The professor was interested in knowing what impact the neural net had in the older models which did not have pure features. The professor believed it was worthwhile to improve the net, though he also expressed that nets were occasionally over used.","The professor thought that the discriminative information of the neural net was important but that it was difficult to quantify. He wanted the team to continue exploring ways to combine information from multiple streams, including a second stream that contained mel log information. He thought that the latency of the feature computation could be reduced by, for example,"
"The team thought that the most noisy cases were the distant microphone testing. That is when there were non-stationary noises in the background, like from a car, a babble or subway. These presented a unique challenge for the model that could potentially be best solved with a neural net.",The professor thought that the video projector and air conditioner were the sources of noise in the recordings. The team was concerned that the noise could affect the performance of the speech recognition. The professor thought that the most noisy cases were those that had been pre-segmented by hand. Those segments were noisier than the automatically pre-
The VAD neural net had twelve times nine inputs and two outputs. The system had improved significantly. It added some latency but the team could potentially run it in parallel.,"The team was making progress on a new VAD. The preliminary results showed a slight improvement compared to the old VAD, with a lower delay. Additionally, the team was working on a parallel VAD without the neural network. It was making progress, though more work was needed. The professor wanted the team to investigate"
The professor wanted to know how much latency the VAD was adding to the model. The professor thought that the process could work in parallel. The professor informed the team that the max latency was unknown.,"The professor expressed that he was not sure how to reduce latency. He initially suggested running the VAD in parallel with the tandem net to reduce total latency. He then proposed an alternative, which was to take the feature that was being fed into the VAD and fed it into the other one as well. This way,"
"PhD C explained that the silence probabilities had a 100ms delay, the delta at the input had a 40ms delay, and a 10ms delay was created by LDA filters.","The latency of the VAD was 220 milliseconds. The VAD was used for on-line normalization before the delta computation. The latency of the final MLP was relatively small, so the delay introduced by the VAD was the dominant factor."
User Interface introduced a remote control easy to use and a multi-functional one and preferred the former as it was more user-friendly. Industrial Designer agreed and proposed that a stick or round button for volume control and channel selection could be used and also suggested that the ten digits could be substituted by voice recognition.,"The user interface designer pointed out that remote control with fewer buttons was more user-friendly. Considering the target group of the remote control was below 40 years old, the multi-functional remote control with many buttons was not necessary. Instead, a simple and trendy design could make the remote control more competitive in the market"
Industrial Designer thought the ten buttons looked a bit dull so speech recognition could be added to solve this problem. But he was concerned that power saving could be difficult when implementing speech recognition.,"Industrial Designer thought that the ten digits were not so relevant because the user could use about ten buttons for regular TV networks. Also, he believed that these ten buttons might look a bit dull and suggested the use of shape, size, or colour to make them fancier. He further pointed out that voice recognition could be used"
"User Interface found two kinds of remote controls: the multi-functional one and the one easy to use. He emphasized on user-friendliness, but considering that the target people were less than forty years old, multi-function should also be taken into account.","User Interface found two different kinds of remote controls - multi-function and easy to use. The former was characterized by many possibilities while the latter by the feeling of touching the buttons. User Interface recommended the easy-to-use one for its user-friendliness.

"Industrial Designer introduced how the remote control worked and supposed that they should use infrared so that the remote control could communicate with most TV sets. He also proposed to use energy-friendly components and save the cost of circuit boards to develop elaborate lighting techniques. In order to prevent people from losing the remote control, the team decided to implement an audio signal. In terms of energy source, the team preferred to have a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged.","The group first decided to scrap teletext because it was out of date and the board felt that the internet was replacing teletext. They then had to decide on the target group and the functions of the remote control. Marketing suggested that they should focus on customers that were younger than forty and new technologies, however, the group"
"User Interface proposed that a base station next to the TV could be a solution, but Industrial Designer pointed out that this could be technically complicated and would cost a lot. So the team eventually adopted Marketing's advice to implement an audio signal.",The team came up with two different kinds of remote controls. One was a multi-function remote control with many possibilities. The other was an ease-of-use remote control with fewer buttons but a better feeling in touching the buttons. The user interface designer recommended the ease-of-use remote control. The industrial designer
"Industrial Designer proposed to incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries, but Project Manager agreed more with Marketing's proposal to include a cradle.","The industrial designer pointed out that the energy source was connected to three things: the user interface, the chip, and the sender. He tried to implement a picture illustrating this, but failed. He went on to make a list of the components of the energy source, including the battery, infrared diode, buttons, chips,"
"Kirsty Williams AM introduced that first of all, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in learning and experience. Second, the government also intended to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects like literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency. Third, a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements would also be included.","The main points that were raised with the White Paper surrounding religious education and relationships and sexuality education were respectively to put a stronger focus on Christianity rather than including other world religions and non-religious views, and to respect parents' views. On the other hand, those who agreed that RE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum"
"Kirsty Williams AM explained that the area of learning and experience for well-being was already there, and what would be included was the things that matter in the area of learning, and it was going to be put into the legislation. Lynne Neagle AM added that every school would have to teach mental health by law since the 'what matters' referred to both physical and mental health, and the government intended to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements were a set given in the system.","The areas of learning and experience for well-being were already there, and under that area of learning title, there were the broad concepts of what felt really mattered in that area of learning. They would be refined, but not added to. And then they would legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original"
"The 'what matters' was the articulation of the big ideas and it was to make sure that essence of the core content was consistent. The actual wording of the 'what matters' statements would be in the secondary legislation. At that time, the need to deliver and the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement would be on the face of the Bill. As a result, mental health would be put in an important place.",The first aspect of the 'what matters' was about health and well-being. It was agreed that it should be included in the curriculum and would be legislated for. The second was about preparing students to be part of a diverse and multicultural society. The last was to make sure that the profession was ready to deliver
"Kirsty Williams AM suggested that Welsh Government had always been big supporters of WISERD (WalesInstitute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods). More research into Welsh education would always be needed. As a Government, all aspects of concerns of Welsh education should be taken into consideration as the government was planning the new curriculum. For instance,  empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teached their children actually gave the government an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of the school children than what they had at the moment.","Kirsty believed that they needed more research into Welsh education, so they big supported the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the work that it did. And they would never undertake a policy reform that they thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system.  Furthermore, Kirsty emphasized that"
"Hefin David AM introduced that the WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams and classroom teachers would share different views towards the change since classroom teachers would be more sceptical. Kirsty Williams AM explained that classroom teachers were absolutely crucial to this, as a result, difficult step had been taken to delay the implementation of the curriculum to same some amount of time to make sure that it was not just school leaders but individual classroom practitioners who had the skills that they would need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allowed them. To ensure this process, different accountability frameworks to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum would be incorporated.","The research suggested that there was no evidence that would happen. These were 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that they needed, as a Government, to take into consideration as they planned the journey. Moreover, the curriculum itself was neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity."
"Hefin David AM asked about what lessons could be learned from the introduction of the Scotish curriculum. Kirsty Williams AM explained some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum, including assessment and content, which had been a crucial part of the process. Also, professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes was an alert to the Welsh government. Steve Davies added that one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content and it could be a fit for the new curriculum.",Scotland had a lot of experience in quality control of the content. They focused a lot on the curriculum and the assessment was bolted on at the end of the process. And they had found that they needed to get a smaller group to develop the materials and look to engage through cluster groups. They had also learned a lot in
"To answer Dawn Bowden AM's question, Kirsty Williams AM first indicated that the money was not an insignificant amount but the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. The money was being made available to each and every school and had empowered head teachers to think about the professional needs of the school and the practitioners in the school. Also it was aimed at a national level, but to start with, schools would be assessed individually.","The money would be utilized to help teachers to get equipped with the professional skills needed for the delivery of the curriculum. Since there were some schools that had been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore were further along that development chain, the money could be used to find out the effective methods of solving the problems"
"The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and continuously, cooperation with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning would be included to campaign for more money allocated specifically beyond the two years.","Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And the money that you announced for this professional development preparation, if you like, was for two years. So, there's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. But is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically"
"Kirsty Williams AM pointed out that all schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into innovation schools, as the next phase. There would be both a downside and an upside for the programme of innovation schools. At this stage, it should be better to move away from the original 's AM concluded that pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. In this case, school with a specific aspect of strength should be encouraged to apply.","The group had slightly refined the pioneer school model and had narrowed down the group of innovative schools. They looked at individuals who had specific expertise in subject areas. The overall concept of the curriculum remained the same, but there would be opportunities to do things better, to explain things better, to simplify where possible and to provide greater"
"Kirsty Williams AM explained that children's rights and human rights had been key considerations throughout the design, and this was currently set out in overarching guidance and the government continued to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And initial assessment from the children's commissioner's office had demonstrated that what was proposed in the new curriculum was a big stepforward. Also, the current existing output of that engagement and feedback had been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning, which was certainly a powerful contribution.","Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that children's rights and human rights were key considerations throughout the design of the curriculum.

Sian Gwenllian AM pointed out that the Learned Society of Wales had said that there should be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Kirsty Williams AM introduced that there was a separate programme of work that was looking at resources needed to support the curriculum and it certainly would be a must.,"The resources to support the Welsh dimension should be broad and not confined to specific areas. The curriculum should include the Welsh contribution to the computing industry. Moreover, the continuum for language would have to be contextualized depending on the setting where a child was being taught to recognize that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school,"
"Kirsty Williams AM suggested that it was really important that whatever resources there were to support the Welsh dimensionare in a broad level and not confined to specific areas. Regardless of the type of schools, attention to the Welsh language should always be included. However, there might be change towards this implementation this year and it was unclear whether it would be discussed by different sectors.","The continuum for language would have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child was being taught. This was because they had to recognize that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school, their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a"
It is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output. This makes the structure more flexible in terms of coding feature-layer probabilities. ,"Grad B thought that their initial attempt to connect all the features to the output node may not be satisfying due to some reasons, including the difficulty of setting up the probabilities and the potential handicap in the subsequent learning process. Also, the flat structure would not look pretty. Grad B then introduced the context, which had three different"
"The next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters. Although, in theory, traditional AI plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions, the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task. ","The team decided that the most satisfying way to proceed would be to add a middle layer. The thinking behind this was that the features they had collected so far, the ones that they could extract from the data, were the ones that pertained to the user's intention.

"There was a demonstration of the structure and the function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task. The features nodes include things like prosody, discourse, verb choice, ""landmark-iness"" of a building, time of day and whether the admission fee was discussed.","The team thought that the discourse could be analyzed for more general patterns of intentionality, beyond those related to the task of collecting the corpus. For example, they thought that something could be added to the model to explain why people might want to take a picture of something. Similarly, information on the speakers' beliefs about who"
"The values these nodes take feed into the middle layer nodes identified as hidden variables of the user/device interaction, such as whether the user is on tour, running an errand or in a hurry. These, in turn, help infer whether the user wants to see, enter or simply approach a building.","The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea. The features that they have drawn from the communication of some discourse will be s along the lines of where they want to go and what they've said previously. The hidden variables they came up with were whether someone was on a tour, running an errand,"
"SmartKom, although it does not code for intentions as specified in this task, provides a model of the discourse, which can be useful for the detection of features through querying and anaphora resolution. ","SmartKom was a tool that the team could use to accomplish many tasks. For one, it allowed the team to parse language and extract intentions. It also helped with anaphora resolution and kept the team updated on who said what. Additionally, it was capable of filling in omitted information and making predictions about the discourse."
"Experiments for the collection of new data will start soon, since someone who will recruit subjects and help run the experiments has already been hired and the designing of the experiments has also progressed significantly.",The group mentioned that they would need to hire additional workers as the project moves forward.
"The group thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria. Although they had brilliant ideas and designed a best remote control within their capacity, they just designed a product of high quality but low acceptance.","The team agreed that the remote control had sufficient features for the market it was targeting, especially with the incorporation of voice recognition. While it lacked certain features that a regular remote control had, such as the number buttons, the team believed that the simplicity and novelty of their remote control were its advantages. Also, the remote control"
User Interface believed that voice recognition was hard to learn while Industrial Designer argued that the remote control had two parts and everyone could use the basic part. He also pointed out that an advanced user would like to explore additional functions.,"The remote control was basic and easy to use for novice users while advanced users could explore more advanced functions such as voice recognition. Therefore, the group agreed to give it a 2.5 out of 7."
Marketing thought that the basic layout was mundane but the voice recognition was brilliant. User Interface added that it did not have the digits but had all the features a normal remote control had. Industrial Designer agreed but pointed out that they just design the best product within their capacity.

"Marketing set the criteria for evaluation. The group gave two points on the fancy look and feel, three points on the ease of use and learnable, and two points on technological innovation because the group thought new features were not all extraordinary.

Lastly, they gave high marks on the room for creativity and leadership.","Marketing had some evaluation criteria based on the market research and the marketing strategy. The team should rate each feature of the product according to the seven-point scale. The team rated the beautiful and fancy look as the high priority.

Project Manager thought the second layer of the remote was not easy to learn but Industrial Designer responded that users would not need to pay attention to that part. The group reached a consensus that the scroll wheel was much better than average. So they gave a two on this criterion.,"The team agreed that the device was fancy rather than beautiful. Also, it was easy to use and learnable. The scrollwheel brought technological innovation to the remote control. And the speech function was also a new feature. All these made the product competitive among other similar products."
"Project Manager thought they should skip the speaker when User Interface mentioned the power indicator.

"They all agreed that most employers did not have a clear understanding of what Welsh bac means or what it includes, which was a big problem not only for employers, but also for parents and young people. Though some small engaged employers did understand it, the vast majority focused more on running the business without a clear understanding.","The group agreed that most employers had a limited understanding of the Welsh bac. They also agreed that employers were more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business, which made it difficult for them to understand what the Welsh bac was about and how much it mattered. However, some people believed that"
"Ed Evans thought employers did not understand it, but they would appreciate it if they do. This was particularly true for his own sector, the civil engineering sector, and particularly contracting sector. Because pupils usually did not have a very strong academic background in this sector, and Welsh bac gave them the opportunity to not pursue that much of academic, but tested them in terms of the challenges. Therefore, the growth of the Welsh bac would be valued at least for this sector.","Ed Evans agreed with Kay Martin that employers did not understand the Welsh baccalaureate well. He thought they would appreciate this qualification once they understood what it was about. For his sector in particular—the civil engineering sector—and particularly the contracting sector, which depended very much on pupils who had come through from a less academic background"
"They proposed that the voice of employers should be a key part of reviewing the qualification. Instead of colleges or qualifications boards doing this, employers themselves should do this qualification, which accorded to the vision of the Welsh baccalaureate, to improve skills for employment. They really should join employers and schools and education facilities together more in the future.",1.  Provide more information to the public and make sure people are aware of the changes and the reasons behind them.
"One thing needing to be cleared was that Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications, but not just one qualification. To develop the employability skills was obviously a key part of it, but not all of it. It obviously worked well to help prepare for employment, but was not for everyone, because some people had to do the other things. It helped prepare some people, such as the A level students for university, but did not help health and social care people become more skilled and employable.","Dafydd Evans thought having a qualification status for the Welsh bac would drive certain behaviors, and they needed to be aware of that. Also, they had a number of children coming in for the colleges, and they needed to resit their GCSEs in maths, English and Welsh. It was a valid priority for the"
"Kay Martin agreed with other people's opinion. They tried their best to help learners to develop skills and employable people. Welsh bac worked well for preparing employment for some people, but not for everybody. Because some people came to school with very few GCSAs, or were lacking literacy or numeracy skills. Kay Martin thought this needed to be reviewed, to look at how they could actually make skilled and employable people.","The principal thought it helped some people - the A-level students for university. But for the health and social care, it was not useful. In addition, as a college, their job was to develop skills and employable people, and they used every tool in their box to do that. The Welsh bac was one"
"Dafydd Evans though that one of the problems was that there were a number of priorities. For example, there were a number of students who needed to resit their GCSE. It was important for everybody to get a C grade in those core subjects, but that would take some time from them teaching young people. Therefore, there were fewer and fewer doing level 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they were resitting their GCSEs. Nick Brazil added that Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications, and developing the employment was one of the key parts, but not all of it.","When first discussing this topic, Nick Brazil thought the initial vision for the Welsh bac was a good one, focusing on learners' skills. However, it had gradually become more of a qualification than a tool to help with employability. Also, there were already many programs out there that worked extremely well, so they should focus more"
"They thought most universities did not understand, based on some experience they had with some of their learners that went to Russell Group universities. But this depended on the admission tutors and the areas that they were going. Some areas valued it more, but some others did not.","Most people agreed that the baccalaureate had not gained a firm hold in the minds of university people, especially those in the Russell Group. And also, the baccalaureate was trying to be all things to all men, which made it not rigorous enough. What's more, people held different opinions towards"
"Nick Brazil proposed an example of the institution himself was in.

Postdoc E was championing the need to get proficient English speakers so as to allow for a stable language model. This did not mean limiting the type of accents that the speakers had but rather ensuring the speakers could proficiently follow the English grammar when they expressed themselves.,The group was concerned about getting more native speakers for their project. The problem was that the group needed people with good language skills to participate in their meetings. The professor thought that they should target graduate students since they had the necessary proficiency in English. Adam suggested that they should run ads in the campus newspaper to attract participants.
One proposed solution was to set up another room in the linguistics department. This needed a dedicated partner and safety of the equipment for it to work. Professor D talked about making the equipment portable allowing it to be transported from meeting to meeting.,"The group discussed the possibility of putting the recording equipment in a meeting room and guaranteeing that the equipment would be safe.

The shape of the remote will be different than normal, like a shell or something along those lines. An alarm will be added in case the remote is lost. The target market will be young business people.","The minutes from the last meeting showed that some changes had been made in their plans. Firstly, teletext was not going to be a control for everything. Secondly, to incorporate the image of the company into the remote control. Also, they had decided on a flip design and a different shape from that which was normal."
Market research was done with a hundred subjects and Marketing concluded the most important aspect required in the device is a fancy look and feel. The second and third important aspects are technologically innovative and being easy to use. Fruits and vegetables can be taken into consideration when thinking about design themes as they were the themes of fashion fairs in Paris and Milan. There is also a trend towards a spongy feel to materials.,"The marketing department conducted a market research study with a hundred subjects and found that the most important aspect for remote controls was a fancy look and feel, followed by technological innovativeness, and then ease of use. The fashion update from Paris and Milan showed that fruit and vegetable themes, and a spongy feel would be the most popular"
"Industrial Designer explained that TA11835 is a chip used in pretty much every remote control to send out standard signals based on the input. On the other hand, most current remotes use a silicone printed circuit board (PCB board) which connects the circuits so that the messages would be sent to the chip. The size should be decided as the board can be custom made.","The most standard and available chip at the moment is the TA1835, which is used in almost every remote control. For the battery, although there are no rechargeable options, the basic battery can be applied, such as the double A or triple A. Also, the circuit board can be printed in various sizes"
"Standard AA and AAA are bulky but the cheapest. Dynamo and dual charging with normal batteries and solar charging take up too much space. Solar charging is the second cheapest but not resistant to dropping. Also, Project Manager believed it would limit the market. Kinetic charging is small and portable but market research should be done first. No rechargeable battery options were available. The remote could have a standby mode and the lights behind the buttons would be switched off after five or ten seconds when not in use.","The team first considered whether to use standard triple A_ batteries or dynamo batteries. User Interface suggested that standard triple A_ might be more space-saving and lighter, while dynamo would be bulkier. Project Manager pointed out that solar energy was not practical since it relied on the sun. Given the fact that most people watched"
"Titanium is too expensive, would be easily dented and could only do a standard box shape whereas plastic could be made into different curved shapes. Marketing suggested making the basic mould out of plastic with a rubber cover, which would give a spongy feel and be a cheap way to change the look of the device. Industrial Designer, User Interface and Project Manager quickly jumped on board with this idea.","The consultants in Paris and Milan who attended all the design and fashion fairs there found that fruit and vegetables would be the theme for clothes, shoes, and furniture. So the group considered using something like that in the remote control design. Also, they found a trend towards a spongy feel to materials. The factory could provide plastic"
"The team planned to do touch screen and there are two options to choose from, a bare PCB circuit board which could be in different colours and making a connection by the touch of fingers, and anti RSI rubber buttons with a LCD type of screen. Industrial Designer doubted whether a LCD screen is wanted as it would only be in black and white but have not thought out how to distinguish where to press if the bare PCB circuit board is used.",Marketing suggested taking inspiration from fruit colours for the remote control. User Interface proposed to keep the remote control simple with a standardised pattern and to add voice recognition. Industrial Designer agreed and suggested adding a backlight to make the remote control look cooler. Project Manager proposed to use kinetic energy as the power source. The team agreed on it
Industrial Designer thought it would be lost easily and Marketing responded that it would be easy and cheap to replace or a pencil or pen could be used instead. User Interface pointed out that a person who switches channels often or uses a particular function will find it irritating to use and might spoil the touchpad more easily compared to a button. Industrial Designer agreed with User Interface.,"Marketing suggested that they could design a stylus and attach it to the device, so that users could use their fingers or the stylus to press the buttons on the touch screen. The advantage of this design was that it would be easy to replace and it was cheap. However, the team was concerned that the stylus would be lost"
"Project Manager believed that it would not appeal to men as they were unlikely to use it when watching television. Marketing responded by leaving this idea on the side, and Industrial Designer and Project Manager agreed. In the end, Marketing gave up on the idea.",Marketing suggested that they could put mirrors on the remote control to attract customers' attention. Project Manager agreed to add some attractive design but he thought that the mirror might not be useful for the remote control. Industrial Designer said that they could achieve the mirror effect through the LCD display. Marketing agreed and suggested adding other features for the
The chip TA11835 and PCB board will be used in the device. The use of kinetic charging was agreed by the team with a standby mode to save battery. The case of the device would be in plastic and would have a changeable rubber cover. LCD screens will be adopted. The idea of adding a stylus or a mirror to the device was rejected.,"The factory can provide plastic for the case, and the group decided to go for this option as it was the cheapest. They also wanted rubber buttons for the anti-RSI effect, but this was not available in the factory. For the case, they could also go for wood, but it would be impractical. If"
"Mostly black and white colours, the normal ones are monotonous without consistency between models, and the buttons are very disorganized. The new remote will have a graphic user interface in the middle of the flip top and certain standard buttons with vibrant fruit colours. A newly developed speech recognition feature can be incorporated in the device and the idea was endorsed by customers. User Interface gave an example of using the feature - locating the remote. The idea was well-received by the team.","The normal remotes are usually black or white, with a rectangular shape. There are not many varieties. One of the most confusing problems about normal remotes is that each one is different from the others. In contrast, the new remote can be designed with a more trendy and fashionable outlook, for example, it can be"
"Industrial Designer said that it would be cheaper to re-manufacture if these parts were already in stock. Project Manager pointed out that the other materials used were relatively cheap and simple. Though the LCD would be expensive, it would be cheaper with black and white than full colour so User Interface suggested that they could start off with black and white and upgrade later.","Project Manager reckoned that the only pitfall that they would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means they have to cut down somewhere else. However, they could start with the black and white LCD screen display and the simple rubber buttons and move on to the more technologically innovative and fancier ones later"
