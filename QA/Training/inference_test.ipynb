      "Industrial Designer: Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}\n",
      "User Interface: You could change the vegetable , or fruit .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: yeah , I can change the vegetable .\n",
      "Project Manager: Oh is that broccoli ? {vocalsound}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .\n",
      "User Interface: Yeah .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .\n",
      "Project Manager: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .\n",
      "Marketing: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\n",
      "Project Manager: 'S a very bright strawberry . {vocalsound}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .\n",
      "User Interface: It's been a l\n",
      "Project Manager: {vocalsound}\n",
      "User Interface: It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\n",
      "Project Manager: Oh yeah .\n",
      "User Interface: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator . How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .\n",
      "User Interface: Okay so that's just {disfmarker}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere\n",
      "User Interface: So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: Yeah we didn't design that .\n",
      "User Interface: Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: But it would be coordinating with that of course .\n",
      "User Interface: Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .\n",
      "Project Manager: Yeah .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\n",
      "User Interface: You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . {vocalsound}\n",
      "Project Manager: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}\n",
      "User Interface: So . Tada .\n",
      "Project Manager: Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . {vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Project Manager: I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be {disfmarker}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .\n",
      "Project Manager: Oh . Okay .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and {disfmarker} d I dunno what that means .\n",
      "Project Manager: Right .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: One side is curved and then the other side is curved .\n",
      "Project Manager: Well {disfmarker} yeah . If we're talking about the area just {disfmarker} oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Marketing: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Project Manager: Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?\n",
      "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\n",
      "Project Manager: Um and lots of special colours actually . {vocalsound} Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ?\n",
      "Industrial Designer: No I think that's alright .\n",
      "Project Manager: Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Project Manager: And if we sold a lot of squishy things .\n",
      "User Interface: Mm .\n",
      "Project Manager: Boo yeah . Okay . {vocalsound} S So {disfmarker} Mm . Did y what did you work on ? The {disfmarker}\n",
      "Marketing: Um evaluation criteria .\n",
      "Project Manager: Okay . Do you wanna {disfmarker}\n",
      "Marketing: I've got a presentation .\n",
      "Project Manager: Okay . I think that's {disfmarker}\n",
      "Marketing: So I need {disfmarker} where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't {disfmarker} okay . Um the method is {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is {disfmarker} everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And {vocalsound} we we have therefore in total um {disfmarker} We have five {disfmarker} we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?\n",
      "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\n",
      "Marketing: Um so the que the questions I've given you {disfmarker} c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Marketing: I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .\n",
      "User Interface: Yeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own {disfmarker} {gap}\n",
      "Marketing: Yeah it's in the um {disfmarker} it's in the project documents .\n",
      "User Interface: Is it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes .\n",
      "Marketing: It's called evaluation criteria .\n",
      "User Interface: Okay .\n",
      "Marketing: And it's under evaluation .\n",
      "Project Manager: Huh , the PowerPoint one ?\n",
      "Industrial Designer: Hmm ?\n",
      "User Interface: Okay . Cool .\n",
      "Marketing: Yeah . You've found it all ?\n",
      "Project Manager: Yeah .\n",
      "Marketing: So it was um {disfmarker} Yeah true's one .\n",
      "User Interface: True's one and false is seven .\n",
      "Marketing: Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?\n",
      "Project Manager: Um we can do it separately and then discuss it\n",
      "Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah okay .\n",
      "Project Manager: if if that's what people wanna do .\n",
      "User Interface: So it's actually a scale .\n",
      "Project Manager: Wait , one is true and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\n",
      "Marketing: {vocalsound} Um ,\n",
      "Project Manager: so these are the questions we're answering . And one is {disfmarker}\n",
      "Marketing: yes it's {disfmarker} if it's fancy you put one ,\n",
      "Project Manager: One , right okay .\n",
      "Marketing: if it's really unfancy it's seven .\n",
      "Project Manager: If it's somewhere in between you put four .\n",
      "Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , something .\n",
      "Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\n",
      "User Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Does it feel fancy ?\n",
      "Project Manager: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Feels like play-dough .\n",
      "Marketing: {vocalsound}\n",
      "User Interface: {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound}\n",
      "Marketing: They shouldn't really be questions . Should be more like {disfmarker} Are the batteries easy to insert ? {vocalsound}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: I'm gonna say yes . {vocalsound}\n",
      "Marketing: Yes ? Very very true . Okay .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I imagine they're somewhere on the front . We have a little case that you slip 'em in .\n",
      "Marketing: Okay .\n",
      "Project Manager: Are we just about ready ?\n",
      "Marketing: Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we {disfmarker} um is it necessary ?\n",
      "Project Manager: I don't think so . It's {disfmarker}\n",
      "Marketing: We'll just do um {disfmarker}\n",
      "Project Manager: yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we {disfmarker}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}\n",
      "Marketing: {vocalsound}\n",
      "User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay .\n",
      "Project Manager: Our animals will forever be there .\n",
      "Marketing: Yeah . Okay .\n",
      "Project Manager: {vocalsound} Un unless you feel you need it t to {disfmarker}\n",
      "Marketing: I don't feel any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\n",
      "Project Manager: okay okay .\n",

      "Project Manager: I I think we should {disfmarker}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's four if you wanna do that .\n",
      "Project Manager: Yeah .\n",
      "Marketing: Yeah ?\n",
      "Project Manager: Yeah .\n",
      "Industrial Designer: It adds to sixteen , so that's four .\n",

      "Industrial Designer: Oh I thought she said five .\n",
      "User Interface: Hmm .\n",

      "Marketing: Well uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\n",
      "Industrial Designer: Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top {vocalsound} .\n",

      "Barry Hughes: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. So one would hope that the law will change to reflect the way in which people behave within society.\n",
      "Barry Hughes: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that.\n",
      "Dawn Bowden AM: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales—well, and in England, actually, across the border—will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law?\n",
      "Barry Hughes: Not as of the present day. Give us a chance. [Laughter.]\n",
      "Dawn Bowden AM: But you would expect that to be something you would—\n",
      "Barry Hughes: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. So, actually, I'm probably being unfair to myself. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen.\n",
      "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes?\n",
      "Suzy Davies AM: Okay, that's really helpful, thank you.\n",
      "Lynne Neagle AM: Before we move on, can I just ask—? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18—\n",

      "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now specifically on prosecutions and potential alternatives from Vikki Howells.\n",
      "Vikki Howells AM: Thank you, Chair. You've already touched quite a bit on the issue of the public interest test. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill?\n",
